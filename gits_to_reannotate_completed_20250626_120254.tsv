It's tagged with Alzheimer's disease-related topics and is designed for biomedical informatics applications.	Aliro is an AI-driven data science assistant platform designed to make machine learning analysis accessible to researchers without coding expertise. The system provides a web interface for conducting supervised machine learning analyses and includes an AI assistant that recommends appropriate analysis methods based on dataset characteristics. The platform builds a knowledge base from previous analyses and the PMLB benchmark suite to improve its recommendations over time. Key features include automated machine learning (AutoML), results visualization, and generation of reproducible scripts. The platform is particularly focused on supporting biomedical research applications, as evidenced by its development at Cedars-Sinai's Department of Computational Biomedicine and its application in biomedical informatics studies.	While specific data formats are not explicitly detailed in the repository information, the system works with: - Supervised machine learning datasets - Dataset profiles stored in a knowledge base - Data from the PMLB (Penn Machine Learning Benchmarks) suite - Biomedical research data (implied by context and institutional affiliation) Specific file formats and data structures are not specified in the provided repository information.	- Primary Language: JavaScript - Web interface framework (implied by repository description) - CI/CD pipeline (evidenced by GitHub Actions workflow) - Testing framework (indicated by coverage badges) - AutoML capabilities (mentioned in topics and description) - Visualization tools (mentioned in features) - GPL v3 licensed software components More specific technical dependencies and frameworks are not detailed in the provided repository information.

It's a collaboration between major medical institutions (UPenn and Cedars-Sinai).	AlzKB is a knowledge base platform that creates and manages a graph database specifically for Alzheimer's Disease research. The system migrated from Neo4j to Memgraph (as of v1.3.0) and provides a structured way to store and query relationships between various Alzheimer's-related data points. The platform allows researchers to build the knowledge base either from scratch or by importing pre-built database files (CYPHERL format). The system appears to integrate various third-party database sources into a unified ontology structure, making it easier for researchers to query and analyze Alzheimer's Disease-related data relationships. The platform supports AI research applications by providing a structured knowledge graph that can be queried and analyzed programmatically.	- Graph database structures (Neo4j legacy format and CYPHERL format) - OWL 2 ontology data - MySQL database dumps from third-party sources - Knowledge graph relationships (specifically mentioning DRUGCAUSESEFFECT relationships) - Integrated third-party database sources (specific formats not detailed)	- Python (v3.7 or later) - Memgraph Lab (Desktop application) - Memgraph Server (optional alternative) - MySQL (for building from source) - Neo4j (legacy versions) - 'ista' library (for ontology population) - Graph database query interfaces - CYPHERL file format support - Git version control
Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project	ADSP	Alzheimer's Disease	https://github.com/ZhiGroup/DeepENDO	ZhiGroup	khushpatelmd	Python	YES - This repository is directly related to biomedical research, specifically focusing on brain imaging genetics and Alzheimer's disease research. It implements deep learning methods to analyze brain MRI data for genetic association studies.	This repository implements DeepENDO, a deep learning framework that uses unsupervised learning to analyze brain imaging data for genetic studies. The core functionality is a 3D convolutional autoencoder that generates 128-dimensional imaging-derived endophenotypes (UDIPs) from brain MRI scans. The system helps identify genetic variants associated with brain structure and function. The repository includes tools for training the model, generating phenotypes, and interpreting results through a perturbation-based decoder-interpretation (PerDI) approach. The code successfully identified 9,457 significant SNPs across 97 independent genetic loci, with 60 loci being replicated. The project represents a significant advancement in combining deep learning with genetic association studies in neuroimaging.	- Brain MRI data (T1 and T2 weighted images) - Genetic data (SNPs - Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) - UK Biobank preprocessed brain imaging data - Model weights (stored externally on Google Drive) - 3D imaging data requiring linear registration - Brain region mapping data - GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study) results	1.

Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project	ADSP	Alzheimer's Disease	https://github.com/RitchieLab/biofilter	RitchieLab	XueqiongLi; van-truong; vermaa1; scdudek	Python	"YES - This repository is clearly biomedical in nature, specifically related to Alzheimer's disease research as indicated by the topics (alzheimer, alzheimers) and the NIH/NIA grant reference (u01ag066833). The ""biofilter"" name and implementation suggest it's a tool for biological data filtering and analysis."	Biofilter appears to be a Python-based tool for biological data filtering and analysis, currently in version 3.0 development. Based on the file structure and sizes, it implements a comprehensive class-based system (classbiofilter.py) for biological data processing. The repository seems focused on providing filtering capabilities for genetic or genomic data, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease research. The presence of a linkage disequilibrium (LD) regions file for CEU populations (ld-CEU-b37.regions) suggests it's used for genetic association studies and population genetics analyses. The repository is actively maintained but notes that previous versions are considered archived and shouldn't be used.	- Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) data for CEU populations (evidenced by ld-CEU-b37.regions file) - Build 37 genomic coordinates (indicated by b37 in filename) - Python source code files (.py) - Documentation in restructured text format (.rst) - The size of the LD regions file (3MB) suggests it contains comprehensive genomic mapping data	- Primary programming language: Python - Version control: Git/GitHub - Documentation: ReStructuredText (RST) format - Appears to be part of an AI/ML pipeline (based on 'aiml' topic tag) - Additional specific tools and dependencies are not specified in the available repository information
