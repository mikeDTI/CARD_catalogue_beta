This repository contains code for an AI-powered intelligent tutoring system called AdamsBrain, specifically designed to help students in West Africa prepare for their WASSCE (West African Senior School Certificate Examination) exams. The project is under development with a planned multi-platform approach, including a web application built with Next.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend API. A mobile version using React Native is planned for future development. The project follows a weekly development schedule, with initial focus on setup and structure, followed by planned implementations of authentication, UI, AI integration, and testing phases.	Not specified - The repository information does not provide details about specific data types, formats, or sources being used in the system.	- Next.js (Frontend web framework) - Express.js (Backend API framework) - React Native (Planned for mobile development) - AI integration (specific tools not mentioned) - Authentication system (specific implementation not detailed)

It appears to be a news aggregation and sharing application with no direct connection to medical or scientific research."	This repository contains a web-based news application called BRAINFOOD that allows users to interact with articles in various ways. The application's main features include viewing articles, posting new articles, categorizing content by topics, and implementing a voting system. Users can also engage through comments, with the ability to post and delete their own comments. The application includes user authentication, with a hardcoded user (@jessjelly) for testing purposes. It's built as a frontend application that runs on a local development server and appears to be deployed on Netlify.	- User data (usernames, authentication information) - Article content - Comments - Voting data - Topic categories Specific file formats are not mentioned in the repository information.	- Node.js/npm (package management) - React.js (implied by the npm start and localhost:3000 configuration) - Netlify (deployment platform) - Development server running on localhost:3000 - npm dependencies (specific packages not listed in provided information)

Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Trials Dataset	ADCS	Alzheimer's Disease; Mild Cognitive Impairment	https://github.com/bothlab/galdur	bothlab	ximion		YES - This repository is directly related to neuroscience research, specifically for detecting Sharp-Wave-Ripple events in brain signals and enabling their disruption, which is a common technique in neuroscience research.	The GALDUR board is a hardware solution designed as a Raspberry Pi hat (add-on board) that enables high-speed detection of neural events. The system integrates with Intan Technologies RHD2000 USB Interface Board for brain signal acquisition and works in conjunction with LaBrStim software or the Syntalos platform. Its primary purpose is to detect Sharp-Wave-Ripple events in neural recordings with low latency and provide capability for event disruption. The board features dual 16-bit ADCs for signal input, a 16-bit DAC for output generation, UART connectivity for host communication, and a real-time clock for precise timing. This hardware solution appears to be designed specifically for neuroscience research applications requiring precise timing and fast response capabilities.	- Analog signals (through ADC inputs) - Digital signals (through DAC output) - Brain signal recordings (from Intan RHD2000 board) - Sharp-Wave-Ripple event data - Real-time clock data (date/time)	- Raspberry Pi 3/4+ platform - Intan Technologies RHD2000 USB Interface Board - LaBrStim software - Syntalos platform - Hardware components: - Two 16-bit ADCs - One 16-bit DAC - UART interface - Real-time clock module - Hardware description files (specific format not specified)
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Grand Opportunities	ADNI-GO	Alzheimer's Disease; Early Mild Cognitive Impairment; Normal Controls	https://github.com/himanshub1007/Alzhimers-Disease-Prediction-Using-Deep-learning	himanshub1007	himanshub1007	Python	YES - This repository is directly focused on medical research, specifically the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease using brain MRI images through deep learning techniques. It has clear applications in neuroscience and clinical diagnostics.	This repository implements a deep learning system for predicting Alzheimer's Disease from brain MRI scans. It utilizes two main approaches: a 2D transfer learning method based on AlexNet and a 3D CNN with autoencoder. The system achieves 86% accuracy using the pretrained 2D AlexNet approach and 77% with the 3D CNN method. The code processes MRI scans through various preprocessing steps including skull-stripping and normalization, then applies deep learning models for classification between AD cases and normal controls. The implementation includes both feature extraction and fine-tuning approaches using transfer learning techniques, making it particularly suitable for limited medical datasets.	- Brain MRI scans from ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) Study - Dataset size: 686 MRI scans (310 AD cases, 376 normal controls) - Preprocessed 3D image files (121x145x121 dimensions) - Data split: Training (n=519), Validation (n=100), Testing (n=67) - Image types: Whole brain (grey and white matter) and grey matter only - Standardized images using International Consortium for Brain Mapping template	1.
