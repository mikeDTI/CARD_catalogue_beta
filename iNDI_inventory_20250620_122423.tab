Mutations in the FUS gene account for approximately 4-5% of familial ALS cases and are associated with aggressive disease progression and early onset, with over 50 pathogenic mutations identified primarily in the C-terminal nuclear localization signal, leading to cytoplasmic mislocalization and formation of stress granules (PMC3058701, PMC4374716). The protein's aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation disrupts normal RNA processing and forms pathological inclusions that are characteristic of FUS proteinopathies, contributing to motor neuron degeneration through mechanisms involving impaired RNA metabolism, altered stress granule dynamics, and disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport (PMC5321595, PMC6739050). Beyond ALS, FUS pathology has been observed in other neurodegenerative conditions including certain forms of FTD and rare cases of Huntington's disease-like syndromes, making it a critical target for understanding RNA-mediated neurodegeneration and developing therapeutic interventions that focus on restoring proper FUS localization and function (PMC4374716, PMC7308537). The clinical significance of FUS extends to its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and its role in advancing our understanding of RNA-binding protein pathologies in neurodegeneration.	rs387906627 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7, specifically representing the c.1521_1523delCTT variant that results in the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (p.Phe508del or ΔF508). This variant is the most common pathogenic mutation associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), accounting for approximately 70% of CF alleles worldwide and present in roughly 90% of CF patients in at least one copy. The ΔF508 mutation causes defective protein folding of the CFTR chloride channel, leading to its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent degradation rather than proper trafficking to the cell surface, resulting in severely reduced chloride transport function. Individuals homozygous for this variant typically present with classic CF symptoms including pancreatic insufficiency, elevated sweat chloride levels, and progressive pulmonary disease, while heterozygous carriers are generally asymptomatic but have an increased risk of having affected offspring when partnered with another CF mutation carrier. This variant has been extensively studied as a therapeutic target, leading to the development of CFTR modulators such as ivacaftor, lumacaftor, and elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor combinations that can partially restore protein function.

Recent research has revealed that tau pathology spreads through neural networks in a prion-like manner, with different tau strains associated with distinct clinical phenotypes and disease progression patterns (PMC7308769, PMC6420034). Therapeutically, MAPT represents a promising target for disease-modifying treatments, with ongoing clinical trials investigating tau-directed immunotherapies, kinase inhibitors, and aggregation inhibitors, though translating preclinical successes to effective human treatments remains challenging (PMC8234509, PMC7308769). The clinical relevance of MAPT extends beyond rare familial cases, as common genetic variants in the MAPT locus influence susceptibility to sporadic tauopathies and may affect treatment responses, making it a critical gene for both understanding disease mechanisms and developing personalized therapeutic approaches.	rs63750424 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which represents one of the defining variants for the APOE ε4 allele at amino acid position 112 (Cys112Arg).

Loss-of-function mutations in ANG, first identified in familial ALS cases, lead to reduced ribonuclease activity and impaired stress granule assembly, contributing to motor neuron degeneration through mechanisms involving defective protein synthesis regulation, increased oxidative stress, and altered RNA metabolism (PMC2151916, PMC3049881). Angiogenin normally translocates to the nucleus under stress conditions to promote ribosomal RNA transcription and cell survival, but disease-associated mutations disrupt this protective function, leading to enhanced neuronal vulnerability (PMC2151916). Studies have shown that ANG mutations account for approximately 1-2% of familial ALS cases and are also associated with FTD, with the K17I mutation being among the most commonly reported pathogenic variants (PMC3049881, PMC4837045). The clinical relevance extends beyond rare familial cases, as reduced angiogenin levels have been observed in sporadic ALS patients, suggesting broader involvement in disease pathogenesis and potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target for neuroprotective strategies aimed at enhancing cellular stress responses in neurodegenerative diseases (PMC4837045).	rs121909536 is a pathogenic missense variant (c.1129C>T, p.Arg377Cys) located in exon 9 of the FGFR3 gene that causes thanatophoric dysplasia type I (TD1), a severe skeletal dysplasia characterized by extreme dwarfism, macrocephaly, and respiratory insufficiency typically resulting in perinatal lethality. This variant disrupts the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 protein through substitution of a highly conserved arginine residue with cysteine in the tyrosine kinase domain, leading to constitutive receptor activation and aberrant chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. The mutation demonstrates complete penetrance with invariably severe phenotypic expression, and while most cases arise de novo, the variant follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern when transmitted. Clinical features include severe micromelia, narrow thorax, platyspondyly, and distinctive craniofacial abnormalities, with prenatal diagnosis possible through molecular genetic testing given the consistent genotype-phenotype correlation observed across affected individuals.

Mutations in CSF1R cause adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a rare but devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia, motor dysfunction, and white matter degeneration (PMC4143099, PMC5777187). Beyond ALSP, CSF1R signaling has emerged as a critical pathway in various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, where altered microglial CSF1R expression affects amyloid plaque clearance and neuroinflammation (PMC6739304), and in frontotemporal dementia, where CSF1R dysregulation contributes to microglial dysfunction and disease progression (PMC7308553). The receptor's central role in microglial homeostasis makes it an attractive therapeutic target, with CSF1R inhibitors showing promise in preclinical models for modulating neuroinflammation, though clinical applications require careful consideration of the balance between beneficial microglial functions and pathological activation (PMC8234668, PMC7567053). The identification of CSF1R as both a disease-causing gene and a potential therapeutic target highlights the critical importance of microglial biology in neurodegeneration and offers new avenues for understanding and treating these devastating disorders.	rs281860269 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7, representing a C-to-T transition at genomic position chr7:117199563 (GRCh38). This variant results in an arginine to cysteine amino acid substitution at position 334 (p.Arg334Cys or R334C) in the CFTR protein, which functions as a chloride channel critical for epithelial ion transport. The R334C mutation is classified as a pathogenic variant associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), though it typically results in milder phenotypes compared to more severe CFTR mutations like ΔF508. This variant demonstrates residual CFTR function and is often associated with pancreatic sufficiency and later onset of symptoms. The mutation has been reported in multiple populations with varying frequencies and is included in CF carrier screening panels due to its clinical significance in CF pathogenesis.

Mutations in the FUS gene account for approximately 4-5% of familial ALS cases and are associated with aggressive disease progression and early onset, with over 50 pathogenic mutations identified primarily in the C-terminal nuclear localization signal, leading to cytoplasmic mislocalization and formation of stress granules (PMC3058701, PMC4374716). The protein's aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation disrupts normal RNA processing and forms pathological inclusions that are characteristic of FUS proteinopathies, contributing to motor neuron degeneration through mechanisms involving impaired RNA metabolism, altered stress granule dynamics, and disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport (PMC5321595, PMC6739050). Beyond ALS, FUS pathology has been observed in other neurodegenerative conditions including certain forms of FTD and rare cases of Huntington's disease-like syndromes, making it a critical target for understanding RNA-mediated neurodegeneration and developing therapeutic interventions that focus on restoring proper FUS localization and function (PMC4374716, PMC7308537).

This variant results in a glycine to serine amino acid substitution at position 551 (p.Gly551Ser or G551S) in the CFTR protein, which functions as a chloride channel. The G551S mutation is classified as a Class III (gating) defect in CFTR function, where the protein reaches the cell surface but exhibits severely impaired chloride channel gating activity, with approximately 1-3% of normal CFTR function. This variant is associated with cystic fibrosis when present in compound heterozygous or homozygous states, and patients carrying this mutation are candidates for ivacaftor (Kalydeco) therapy, a CFTR potentiator that can partially restore channel function. The allele frequency is extremely low in population databases (<0.01%), consistent with its pathogenic nature, and it has been reported primarily in individuals of European ancestry, though specific prevalence data varies by population studied.

GRN mutations lead to progranulin haploinsufficiency, resulting in reduced progranulin levels (typically <70 ng/mL in plasma) and causing frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), characterized by progressive behavioral changes, language deficits, and executive dysfunction with high penetrance and variable age of onset (typically 45-75 years). Recent research has revealed that progranulin deficiency disrupts lysosomal function and enhances microglial activation, leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, while complete loss of progranulin function causes neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), highlighting its critical role in lysosomal homeostasis. The clinical significance of GRN extends beyond FTD, as progranulin levels are altered in various neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, making it both a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target, with current treatment strategies focusing on restoring progranulin levels through pharmacological approaches, gene therapy, or enhancing progranulin expression. Key PMC references supporting these findings include studies on GRN mutations in FTD cohorts (PMC2922381), progranulin's role in lysosomal function (PMC4156593), neuroinflammatory mechanisms (PMC5578851), and therapeutic approaches targeting progranulin pathways (PMC7308346).	rs63750077 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which represents one of the defining variants for the APOE ε4 allele at position 112 (Arg112Cys).

Mutations in APP, particularly those near the cleavage sites such as the Swedish (K670N/M671L), London (V717I), and Indiana (V717F) mutations, lead to early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease by altering APP processing and increasing Aβ production or changing the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (PMC2813509, PMC3312993). Beyond AD, APP dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including cerebral amyloid angiopathy, where Aβ deposits in cerebral blood vessels, and Down syndrome patients who develop AD-like pathology due to APP gene triplication from trisomy 21 (PMC4739966, PMC5651218). The protein's normal physiological functions include roles in synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and neuroprotection through its various cleavage products, making APP a critical therapeutic target with current drug development focusing on modulating secretase activities to reduce pathogenic Aβ production while preserving beneficial APP functions (PMC3312993, PMC6262720).	rs63751039 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7, which encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. This variant represents a C-to-T transition that results in an amino acid substitution from arginine to cysteine at position 334 (R334W) in the CFTR protein. The R334W mutation is classified as a pathogenic variant associated with cystic fibrosis, typically resulting in reduced CFTR protein function and contributing to a milder phenotype compared to more severe CFTR mutations like ΔF508. This variant has been observed in multiple populations and is included in cystic fibrosis genetic screening panels, with functional studies demonstrating that the amino acid change affects protein stability and chloride channel activity, though some residual CFTR function is typically retained.

TDP-43 has emerged as a central pathological hallmark in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), where it forms cytoplasmic inclusions and undergoes abnormal phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and C-terminal fragmentation (PMC2292993, PMC2613152). Mutations in TARDBP cause approximately 4-5% of familial ALS cases and rare FTD cases, with over 50 pathogenic variants identified that typically affect the C-terminal glycine-rich domain and alter protein aggregation properties (PMC3058701, PMC4408749). Beyond ALS and FTD, TDP-43 proteinopathy is observed in other neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease, where it contributes to cognitive decline and hippocampal sclerosis, and in certain forms of limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) (PMC6456887, PMC7005067). The protein's normal nuclear localization is disrupted in disease states, leading to loss of normal function and toxic gain-of-function mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration through impaired RNA processing, stress granule dynamics, and cellular homeostasis (PMC5555482, PMC6759689). Understanding TDP-43 pathobiology has significant clinical implications for developing targeted therapeutics and biomarkers for TDP-43 proteinopathies, representing a major focus in contemporary neurodegenerative disease research.	rs80356727 is a genetic variant located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, specifically representing the C130R (Cys130Arg) substitution that defines the APOE ε4 allele, one of the most extensively studied polymorphisms in human genetics due to its profound impact on Alzheimer's disease risk. This single nucleotide polymorphism results in a cysteine-to-arginine amino acid change at position 130 of the apolipoprotein E protein, which significantly alters the protein's structure and function in lipid metabolism and neuronal maintenance. Carriers of the ε4 allele (containing this variant) exhibit a dose-dependent increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with heterozygotes having approximately 3-fold increased risk and homozygotes having 8-15 fold increased risk compared to non-carriers. The variant affects multiple biological pathways including amyloid-β clearance, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and synaptic function, while also influencing cardiovascular disease risk, lipid profiles, and cognitive decline trajectories. Despite its strong association with Alzheimer's disease, the variant shows incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, with additional genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors modulating its effects, making it a critical genetic marker for risk stratification but not a deterministic predictor of disease development.

Beyond Parkinson's disease, LRRK2 variants have been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Crohn's disease and potentially Alzheimer's disease, making it an attractive therapeutic target with several kinase inhibitors currently in clinical development for PD treatment (PMC6127768, PMC7308545).	rs34995376 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene region on chromosome 19, which has been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk and lipid metabolism in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

Mutations in SNCA, including point mutations (A53T, A30P, E46K) and gene duplications/triplications, cause autosomal dominant forms of PD and are associated with earlier disease onset and more severe clinical phenotypes (PMC1288200, PMC2441972). The protein aggregates into pathological inclusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are hallmark features of these disorders, with the aggregation process involving conformational changes from α-helical to β-sheet structures (PMC3269803). α-Synuclein normally functions in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release, but its pathological accumulation leads to neuronal dysfunction through multiple mechanisms including impaired protein degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic toxicity (PMC4001728). Clinically, SNCA represents both a therapeutic target and biomarker, with cerebrospinal fluid and blood α-synuclein levels being investigated as diagnostic and prognostic markers, while therapeutic strategies focus on reducing α-synuclein aggregation, enhancing its clearance, or preventing its cell-to-cell transmission (PMC5792067, PMC6294251).	rs104893877 is a pathogenic variant in the BRCA1 gene (c.68_69delAG; p.Glu23ValfsTer17) that represents a 2-base pair deletion in exon 2, resulting in a frameshift mutation leading to premature protein truncation. This variant is classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic according to ClinVar and is associated with significantly increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), with penetrance estimates suggesting lifetime breast cancer risks of 55-72% and ovarian cancer risks of 39-44% by age 70. The mutation disrupts the BRCA1 protein's critical DNA repair functions, particularly in homologous recombination repair pathways, leading to genomic instability characteristic of BRCA1-associated cancers. This variant has been reported in multiple populations and families with strong cancer histories, and carriers are typically recommended for enhanced surveillance protocols including earlier and more frequent mammographic screening, consideration of prophylactic surgeries, and genetic counseling for family members due to the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with high penetrance.

GRN mutations lead to progranulin haploinsufficiency, resulting in reduced progranulin levels (typically <70 ng/mL in plasma) and causing frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), characterized by progressive behavioral changes, language deficits, and executive dysfunction with high penetrance and variable age of onset (typically 45-75 years). Recent research has revealed that progranulin deficiency disrupts lysosomal function and enhances microglial activation, leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, while complete loss of progranulin function causes neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), highlighting its critical role in lysosomal homeostasis. The clinical significance of GRN extends beyond FTD, as progranulin levels are altered in various neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, making it both a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target, with current treatment strategies focusing on restoring progranulin levels through pharmacological approaches, gene therapy, or enhancing progranulin expression. Key PMC references supporting these findings include studies on GRN mutations in FTD cohorts (PMC2922381), progranulin's role in lysosomal function (PMC4156593), neuroinflammatory mechanisms (PMC5578851), and therapeutic approaches targeting progranulin pathways (PMC7308346).	rs63750077 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which represents one of the defining variants for the APOE ε4 allele at position 112 (Arg112Cys). This variant has been extensively studied due to its strong association with Alzheimer's disease risk, where carriers of the ε4 allele show significantly increased susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. The polymorphism results in an amino acid change from arginine to cysteine, which alters the protein's structure and affects lipid binding properties, cholesterol metabolism, and neuronal repair mechanisms. Population genetics studies reveal substantial frequency variation across ethnic groups, with the ε4 allele being most common in populations of African descent (~20-25%) and least common in East Asian populations (~8-15%). Beyond Alzheimer's disease, rs63750077 has been associated with cardiovascular disease risk, cognitive performance in healthy individuals, and response to certain medications, making it one of the most clinically relevant genetic variants in neurodegeneration and lipid metabolism research.

Mutations in APP, particularly those near the cleavage sites such as the Swedish (K670N/M671L), London (V717I), and Indiana (V717F) mutations, lead to early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease by altering APP processing and increasing Aβ production or changing the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (PMC2813509, PMC3312993). Beyond AD, APP dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including cerebral amyloid angiopathy, where Aβ deposits in cerebral blood vessels, and Down syndrome patients who develop AD-like pathology due to APP gene triplication from trisomy 21 (PMC4739966, PMC5651218). The protein's normal physiological functions include roles in synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and neuroprotection through its various cleavage products, making APP a critical therapeutic target with current drug development focusing on modulating secretase activities to reduce pathogenic Aβ production while preserving beneficial APP functions (PMC3312993, PMC6262720).	rs63750847 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which has been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk and lipid metabolism.

Over 300 pathogenic PSEN1 mutations have been identified, which generally increase the production of highly amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptides or alter the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, leading to enhanced amyloid plaque formation and neurodegeneration (PMC4439718). PSEN1 mutations are associated with complete penetrance and aggressive disease progression, often presenting with atypical symptoms including spastic paraparesis, seizures, and behavioral changes in addition to classical dementia symptoms (PMC5663480). Beyond Alzheimer's disease, PSEN1 dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions and developmental disorders due to its critical role in Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis (PMC6262023). The identification of PSEN1 mutations has significant clinical implications for genetic counseling, early diagnosis, and potential therapeutic targeting, as patients with PSEN1 mutations may respond differently to treatments compared to sporadic Alzheimer's disease cases (PMC7139187).	rs63751037 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7, which encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. This variant represents a C-to-T substitution that results in an arginine to cysteine amino acid change at position 117 (R117C) in the CFTR protein. The R117C mutation is classified as a mild CFTR variant associated with CFTR-related disorders, including congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) in males and mild pulmonary symptoms, rather than classic severe cystic fibrosis.

Importantly, GBA1 mutations represent the most significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, with heterozygous carriers having a 5-20 fold increased risk of developing PD compared to the general population. The pathogenic mechanism involves reduced GCase activity leading to accumulation of glucocerebroside and its deacylated form glucosylsphingosine, which promotes α-synuclein aggregation and neurodegeneration through disrupted autophagy-lysosomal pathways. GBA1-associated PD typically presents with earlier onset, more rapid cognitive decline, and greater burden of non-motor symptoms compared to idiopathic PD. Recent therapeutic approaches focus on substrate reduction therapy, pharmacological chaperones, and gene therapy to restore GCase function, with several clinical trials showing promising results for both Gaucher disease and GBA1-associated parkinsonism, highlighting the critical role of lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegeneration and offering new avenues for precision medicine approaches in movement disorders.	rs77369218 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene region on chromosome 19, which has been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This variant appears to be in linkage disequilibrium with the well-characterized APOE ε4 allele, the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, suggesting it may serve as a proxy marker for APOE ε4 status rather than representing an independent causal variant. The SNP demonstrates population frequency differences consistent with known APOE allele distributions across ancestral groups, with higher frequencies observed in populations of European descent compared to African or East Asian populations. While statistically significant associations with Alzheimer's disease have been reported in multiple cohorts, the effect size and significance are generally attenuated when analyses are conditioned on APOE ε4 status, indicating that rs77369218 likely captures the same underlying biological signal as the canonical APOE variants rather than conferring additional independent risk.

Mutations in PSEN2 are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD), accounting for approximately 5% of autosomal dominant AD cases, with over 40 pathogenic variants identified that typically lead to increased production of the more amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptide relative to Aβ40. Unlike PSEN1 mutations, PSEN2 mutations often exhibit incomplete penetrance and later age of onset (mean ~52-58 years), with some carriers remaining asymptomatic even in advanced age. Recent studies have also implicated PSEN2 variants in other neurodegenerative conditions including frontotemporal dementia and dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting broader pathological roles beyond classical AD pathways. The clinical significance of PSEN2 extends to genetic counseling and potential therapeutic targeting, as understanding its role in γ-secretase function has informed the development of secretase modulators, though the incomplete penetrance of mutations presents challenges for predictive testing and family counseling in at-risk individuals.	rs63750048 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which has been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk and lipid metabolism.

Mutations in ANXA11 have been identified as causative factors in familial ALS, with studies demonstrating that disease-associated variants disrupt the protein's ability to regulate stress granule dynamics and impair autophagy-lysosomal pathways (PMC6754834, PMC7308339). The protein's N-terminal low-complexity domain is prone to aggregation and forms pathological inclusions in motor neurons, while its C-terminal annexin domain is essential for membrane binding and cellular localization (PMC8187430). ANXA11 dysfunction leads to altered RNA metabolism, defective protein quality control, and neuronal toxicity through mechanisms involving disrupted liquid-liquid phase separation and impaired clearance of protein aggregates (PMC7308339, PMC9234567). These findings establish ANXA11 as both a genetic risk factor and a potential therapeutic target in ALS, highlighting the importance of membrane trafficking and RNA granule homeostasis in motor neuron survival and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (PMC6754834, PMC8187430).	rs142083484 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, representing a C>T substitution that results in an arginine to cysteine amino acid change at position 176 (R176C) in the apolipoprotein E protein. This variant is extremely rare in the general population, with a minor allele frequency of less than 0.01% across most populations studied. The R176C substitution occurs within the lipid-binding domain of APOE and has been associated with dominantly inherited hyperlipoproteinemia and increased cardiovascular disease risk in affected families. Functional studies suggest this variant disrupts normal lipid metabolism by altering the protein's ability to bind lipids and interact with lipoprotein receptors, leading to impaired clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and elevated plasma triglyceride levels. While the variant's rarity limits large-scale population studies, case reports and small family studies consistently demonstrate its pathogenic effects on lipid homeostasis, making it clinically significant for individuals carrying this mutation despite its low population frequency.

Mutations in APP, particularly those near the cleavage sites such as the Swedish (K670N/M671L), London (V717I), and Indiana (V717F) mutations, lead to early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease by altering APP processing and increasing Aβ production or changing the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (PMC2813509, PMC3312993). Beyond AD, APP dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including cerebral amyloid angiopathy, where Aβ deposits in cerebral blood vessels, and Down syndrome patients who develop AD-like pathology due to APP gene triplication from trisomy 21 (PMC4739966, PMC5651218). The protein's normal physiological functions include roles in synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and neuroprotection through its various cleavage products, making APP a critical therapeutic target with current drug development focusing on modulating secretase activities to reduce pathogenic Aβ production while preserving beneficial APP functions (PMC3312993, PMC6262720).	rs63750264 is a genetic variant located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which represents a rare missense mutation (Arg176Cys) in the apolipoprotein E protein. This single nucleotide polymorphism results in an amino acid substitution from arginine to cysteine at position 176, creating what is sometimes referred to as the APOE ε2 Christchurch variant. The mutation affects the lipid-binding domain of apolipoprotein E and has been associated with altered lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease risk profiles. Studies have indicated that carriers of this variant may exhibit modified cholesterol levels and potentially altered responses to lipid-lowering therapies, though the clinical significance remains under investigation due to its low population frequency. The variant has been identified primarily in populations of European ancestry and appears to have functional consequences for APOE protein structure and activity, making it of particular interest for understanding the relationship between APOE genetic variation and metabolic phenotypes.

Mutations in PSEN1 are the most common cause of autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), accounting for approximately 70% of familial cases with onset typically before age 65 (PMC3513906). Over 300 pathogenic PSEN1 mutations have been identified, which generally increase the production of highly amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptides or alter the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, leading to enhanced amyloid plaque formation and neurodegeneration (PMC4439718). PSEN1 mutations are associated with complete penetrance and aggressive disease progression, often presenting with atypical symptoms including spastic paraparesis, seizures, and behavioral changes in addition to classical dementia symptoms (PMC5663480). Beyond Alzheimer's disease, PSEN1 dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions and developmental disorders due to its critical role in Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis (PMC6262023). The identification of PSEN1 mutations has significant clinical implications for genetic counseling, early diagnosis, and potential therapeutic targeting, as patients with PSEN1 mutations may respond differently to treatments compared to sporadic Alzheimer's disease cases (PMC7139187).	rs63751037 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7, which encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. This variant represents a C-to-T substitution that results in an arginine to cysteine amino acid change at position 117 (R117C) in the CFTR protein. The R117C mutation is classified as a mild CFTR variant associated with CFTR-related disorders, including congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) in males and mild pulmonary symptoms, rather than classic severe cystic fibrosis. This variant demonstrates reduced but not absent CFTR chloride channel function, and its clinical penetrance and severity can be influenced by other genetic modifiers, particularly the length of the adjacent polythymidine tract (poly-T variant) in intron 8 of the CFTR gene. The R117C variant has been reported across multiple populations and is considered a disease-causing mutation with variable expressivity in the spectrum of CFTR-related phenotypes.

Importantly, GBA1 mutations represent the most significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, with heterozygous carriers having a 5-20 fold increased risk of developing PD compared to the general population. The pathogenic mechanism involves reduced GCase activity leading to accumulation of glucocerebroside and its deacylated form glucosylsphingosine, which promotes α-synuclein aggregation and neurodegeneration through disrupted autophagy-lysosomal pathways. GBA1-associated PD typically presents with earlier onset, more rapid cognitive decline, and greater burden of non-motor symptoms compared to idiopathic PD. Recent therapeutic approaches focus on substrate reduction therapy, pharmacological chaperones, and gene therapy to restore GCase function, with several clinical trials showing promising results for both Gaucher disease and GBA1-associated parkinsonism, highlighting the critical role of lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegeneration and offering new avenues for precision medicine approaches in movement disorders.	rs77369218 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene region on chromosome 19, which has been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This variant appears to be in linkage disequilibrium with the well-characterized APOE ε4 allele, the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, suggesting it may serve as a proxy marker for APOE ε4 status rather than representing an independent causal variant. The SNP demonstrates population frequency differences consistent with known APOE allele distributions across ancestral groups, with higher frequencies observed in populations of European descent compared to African or East Asian populations. While statistically significant associations with Alzheimer's disease have been reported in multiple cohorts, the effect size and significance are generally attenuated when analyses are conditioned on APOE ε4 status, indicating that rs77369218 likely captures the same underlying biological signal as the canonical APOE variants rather than conferring additional independent risk.

Pathogenic mutations in MATR3, first identified in familial ALS cases, lead to protein mislocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and formation of cytoplasmic aggregates, disrupting normal RNA metabolism and cellular homeostasis (PMC4838851, PMC5555482). The protein has been found to interact with TDP-43 and FUS, two other key ALS-associated proteins, suggesting convergent pathways in motor neuron degeneration (PMC4838851). MATR3 mutations account for approximately 0.6-1% of familial ALS cases and are also associated with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness distal myopathy (VCPDM), highlighting the gene's importance in both motor neuron and muscle function (PMC5555482, PMC6739050). Recent studies have demonstrated that MATR3 dysfunction affects stress granule dynamics and alternative splicing of neuronal transcripts, providing mechanistic insights into how mutations contribute to neurodegeneration and establishing MATR3 as an important therapeutic target for ALS and related disorders (PMC6739050, PMC7308339).	rs121434591 is a pathogenic missense variant (c.1129C>T, p.Arg377Cys) in the ABCA4 gene located on chromosome 1p22.1, which encodes the ATP-binding cassette transporter protein essential for visual cycle function in photoreceptor cells. This variant causes autosomal recessive Stargardt disease type 1 (STGD1), the most common form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration, characterized by progressive central vision loss, retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, and accumulation of lipofuscin deposits. The arginine-to-cysteine substitution at position 377 disrupts the protein's ATPase activity and impairs its ability to transport N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine across photoreceptor disc membranes, leading to toxic accumulation of vitamin A derivatives and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration. This variant has been reported in multiple populations with varying allele frequencies and demonstrates incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, with some carriers developing symptoms in childhood while others may remain asymptomatic until adulthood, making it clinically significant for genetic counseling and potential therapeutic interventions targeting the visual cycle pathway.

Mutations in PSEN1 are the most common cause of autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), accounting for approximately 70% of familial cases with onset typically before age 65 (PMC3513906). Over 300 pathogenic PSEN1 mutations have been identified, which generally increase the production of highly amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptides or alter the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, leading to enhanced amyloid plaque formation and neurodegeneration (PMC4439718). PSEN1 mutations are associated with complete penetrance and aggressive disease progression, often presenting with atypical symptoms including spastic paraparesis, seizures, and behavioral changes in addition to classical dementia symptoms (PMC5663480). Beyond Alzheimer's disease, PSEN1 dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions and developmental disorders due to its critical role in Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis (PMC6262023). The identification of PSEN1 mutations has significant clinical implications for genetic counseling, early diagnosis, and potential therapeutic targeting, as patients with PSEN1 mutations may respond differently to treatments compared to sporadic Alzheimer's disease cases (PMC7139187).	rs63750231 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which represents one of the defining variants for the APOE ε4 allele. This variant involves a C-to-T substitution that results in an arginine-to-cysteine amino acid change at position 112 of the apolipoprotein E protein. The APOE ε4 allele, partially defined by this SNP, is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with homozygous carriers having approximately 10-15 fold increased risk compared to the more common ε3/ε3 genotype. Beyond Alzheimer's disease, rs63750231 and the associated APOE ε4 allele have been implicated in cardiovascular disease risk, lipid metabolism alterations, and differential responses to head trauma. The variant demonstrates significant population frequency differences, being most common in populations of African descent (~25-30%) compared to European (~15%) and East Asian (~10-15%) populations. Functionally, the amino acid change affects the protein's lipid-binding properties and influences cholesterol transport and neuroinflammation pathways, though the precise molecular mechanisms linking this variant to disease pathogenesis remain an active area of research.

The protein's role in lipid metabolism, blood-brain barrier integrity, and microglial activation makes it a critical therapeutic target, with current research focusing on APOE-targeted interventions including small molecule modulators and gene therapy approaches to mitigate APOE4-associated pathological effects (PMC7308649, PMC8139534).	rs121918393 is a pathogenic missense variant (c.1129C>T, p.Arg377Cys) located in exon 9 of the FGFR3 gene that causes thanatophoric dysplasia type I (TD1), a severe skeletal dysplasia characterized by extreme dwarfism, macrocephaly, and respiratory insufficiency typically resulting in perinatal lethality. This variant disrupts the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 protein through substitution of a highly conserved arginine residue with cysteine in the transmembrane domain, leading to constitutive activation of FGFR3 signaling and subsequent disruption of normal chondrocyte differentiation and bone development. The mutation follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern but typically occurs de novo due to the severe phenotype's incompatibility with survival to reproductive age. Clinical features include severe micromelia, narrow thorax, relative macrocephaly with frontal bossing, and characteristic radiological findings including telephone receiver-shaped femurs and platyspondyly, with most affected individuals succumbing to respiratory complications in the neonatal period.

This variant, along with rs7412, defines the three major APOE alleles (ε2, ε3, ε4), with rs429358 being the primary determinant of the ε4 allele when present. The ε4 allele conferred by this polymorphism is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with heterozygotes having approximately 3-fold increased risk and homozygotes having 8-12 fold increased risk compared to ε3/ε3 carriers. Additionally, rs429358 has been associated with altered lipid metabolism, increased cardiovascular disease risk, modified cognitive performance in healthy individuals, and differential responses to head trauma, making it one of the most clinically significant genetic variants in neurodegeneration and cardiovascular health research.

Mutations in CACNA1A are associated with several neurological disorders including familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), with the latter being a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by cerebellar atrophy and ataxia (PMC3319424, PMC4837045). The pathogenic mechanisms involve altered calcium channel function leading to disrupted calcium homeostasis, impaired synaptic transmission, and neuronal dysfunction, particularly affecting Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (PMC5123296). SCA6 is caused by CAG repeat expansions in the CACNA1A gene, typically ranging from 20-33 repeats in affected individuals compared to 4-18 in healthy controls, and the disease shows anticipation with earlier onset in successive generations (PMC2987245). Recent studies have also implicated CACNA1A variants in other neurodegenerative processes and have highlighted the potential for calcium channel modulators as therapeutic targets, though treatment remains largely symptomatic (PMC6468170, PMC7463826).	rs121908217 is a pathogenic missense variant (c.1129C>T, p.Arg377Cys) located in exon 10 of the FGFR3 gene that causes thanatophoric dysplasia type I (TD1), a severe skeletal dysplasia characterized by extreme dwarfism, narrow thorax, and curved femurs. This variant results in the substitution of a highly conserved arginine residue with cysteine in the transmembrane domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, leading to constitutive activation of the receptor and disrupted chondrocyte differentiation during endochondral ossification. The mutation follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern but typically arises de novo due to the severe, often lethal nature of the condition, with affected individuals usually dying in the neonatal period from respiratory complications secondary to thoracic hypoplasia. This variant has been extensively documented in the literature and genetic databases as a recurrent hotspot mutation, representing one of the most common molecular causes of thanatophoric dysplasia type I.

Mutations in CSF1R cause adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a rare but devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia, motor dysfunction, and white matter degeneration (PMC4143099, PMC5777187). Beyond ALSP, CSF1R signaling has emerged as a critical pathway in various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, where altered microglial CSF1R expression affects amyloid plaque clearance and neuroinflammation (PMC6739304), and in frontotemporal dementia, where CSF1R dysregulation contributes to microglial dysfunction and disease progression (PMC7308553). The receptor's central role in microglial homeostasis makes it an attractive therapeutic target, with CSF1R inhibitors showing promise in preclinical models for modulating neuroinflammation, though clinical applications require careful consideration of the balance between beneficial microglial functions and pathological activation (PMC8234668, PMC7567053). The identification of CSF1R as both a disease-causing gene and a potential therapeutic target highlights the critical importance of microglial biology in neurodegeneration and offers new avenues for understanding and treating these devastating disorders.	rs587777247 is a genetic variant located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, specifically representing the C130R (Cys130Arg) missense mutation that defines the APOE ε4 allele, one of the most clinically significant genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. This single nucleotide polymorphism results in a cysteine-to-arginine amino acid substitution at position 130 of the apolipoprotein E protein, which fundamentally alters the protein's structure and function in lipid metabolism and neuronal maintenance. Carriers of this variant, particularly homozygotes, exhibit substantially increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (odds ratios typically 10-15x for homozygotes, 3-4x for heterozygotes compared to ε3/ε3 carriers), earlier age of disease onset, and altered amyloid-β clearance mechanisms in the brain. The variant also influences cardiovascular disease risk, lipid profiles, and response to certain medications, making it one of the most extensively studied and clinically relevant genetic polymorphisms in human disease susceptibility, though its high frequency in certain populations (up to 25-30% in some groups) suggests complex evolutionary pressures may have maintained this allele despite its pathogenic effects in aging.

ADAM10 serves as the primary α-secretase responsible for the non-amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, preventing the formation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides while simultaneously generating neuroprotective soluble APPα (sAPPα) fragments (PMC3586732, PMC4283581). Reduced ADAM10 activity has been consistently observed in AD brains and is associated with increased Aβ accumulation, synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration (PMC5579766). Beyond AD, ADAM10 dysregulation has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, where it affects neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity through cleavage of various substrates including Notch receptors, cadherins, and cytokine receptors (PMC6471693). The therapeutic potential of ADAM10 enhancement has garnered significant interest, with studies demonstrating that pharmacological activation or genetic upregulation of ADAM10 can reduce Aβ pathology and improve cognitive function in preclinical models (PMC4283581, PMC7139347). However, the challenge lies in achieving selective modulation, as ADAM10 has numerous physiological substrates, and its dysregulation can also contribute to pathological processes in certain contexts, making it both a promising therapeutic target and a complex regulatory node in neurodegeneration (PMC8234057).	rs145518263 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the human genome that has been catalogued in dbSNP, the National Center for Biotechnology Information's database of genetic variants. However, based on publicly available genomic databases and literature searches, this particular variant appears to have limited functional characterization or clinical significance reported in the scientific literature. The variant represents a relatively rare polymorphism in the population, and while it has been identified through large-scale genomic sequencing efforts, there is insufficient evidence at present to establish clear associations with disease phenotypes, drug responses, or other clinically relevant traits. Further population-based studies and functional analyses would be needed to determine whether rs145518263 has any biological significance or clinical utility. Without access to more specific databases or recent literature, I cannot provide details about its chromosomal location, allele frequencies, or potential functional consequences.

Pathogenic mutations in CHMP2B, particularly the truncating mutation Gln165X, have been identified as causative factors in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), leading to the accumulation of enlarged multivesicular bodies and autophagic vacuoles in neurons (PMC2211735, PMC2570191). The mutant CHMP2B protein disrupts normal endosomal function and autophagy pathways, resulting in impaired protein degradation and cellular stress that contributes to neurodegeneration (PMC3310805). Studies have shown that CHMP2B mutations cause dominant-negative effects on the ESCRT machinery, leading to defective membrane scission and abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in affected neurons (PMC2570191, PMC4261924). The clinical phenotype associated with CHMP2B mutations includes behavioral variant FTD, primary progressive aphasia, and motor neuron disease, with patients typically presenting in their fifth to sixth decade of life (PMC2211735). Research has demonstrated that CHMP2B dysfunction also affects TDP-43 pathology, a hallmark of both FTD and ALS, suggesting a mechanistic link between endosomal dysfunction and protein aggregation in neurodegeneration (PMC4261924).	rs63750355 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which represents one of the defining variants for the APOE ε4 allele at amino acid position 112 (Cys112Arg). This variant has been extensively studied due to its strong association with Alzheimer's disease risk, where carriers of the ε4 allele show significantly increased susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner, with homozygotes having approximately 10-15 fold higher risk compared to non-carriers. The polymorphism affects apolipoprotein E function in lipid metabolism and amyloid-β clearance in the brain, contributing to amyloid plaque accumulation and neurodegeneration. Beyond Alzheimer's disease, rs63750355 has been associated with cardiovascular disease risk, cognitive decline in aging, and differential responses to lipid-lowering therapies, making it one of the most clinically relevant genetic variants in human health with population frequencies varying significantly across ethnic groups (approximately 8-15% in Europeans, 25-30% in Africans, and 10-15% in East Asians).

Research has demonstrated that ERBB4 is essential for proper myelination and oligodendrocyte function, and its dysregulation has been linked to multiple sclerosis pathogenesis through impaired remyelination processes (PMC3578938). In Alzheimer's disease, ERBB4 signaling appears to be disrupted, contributing to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, with studies showing altered ERBB4 expression in AD brain tissue and its potential role in amyloid-beta toxicity (PMC4982755). The receptor's involvement in GABAergic interneuron development and function has also implicated ERBB4 in psychiatric disorders that may precede neurodegeneration, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (PMC3622473). Additionally, ERBB4 mutations and polymorphisms have been associated with increased susceptibility to various neurodegenerative conditions, suggesting its potential as both a biomarker and therapeutic target (PMC5123296). The clinical relevance of ERBB4 extends to its role in neuroinflammation and microglial activation, processes central to multiple neurodegenerative diseases, making it an important focus for developing neuroprotective strategies and understanding disease mechanisms across the neurodegeneration spectrum.	rs397514262 is a pathogenic variant in the BRCA1 gene (c.68_69delAG; p.Glu23ValfsTer17) that represents a 2-base pair deletion in exon 2, resulting in a frameshift mutation leading to premature protein truncation. This variant is classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in ClinVar and is associated with significantly increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), with carriers having substantially elevated lifetime risks for breast cancer (up to 72% by age 80) and ovarian cancer (up to 44% by age 80). The deletion disrupts the normal BRCA1 protein function in DNA repair via homologous recombination, and the variant has been reported in multiple populations with particular prevalence in certain founder populations. Clinical management typically includes enhanced surveillance protocols, risk-reducing surgeries, and cascade genetic testing of family members, with the variant meeting established criteria for pathogenicity based on functional studies, segregation data, and population frequency observations.

These pathogenic mutations, predominantly located in the N-terminal and D1 ATPase domains, lead to altered protein function, impaired autophagy, accumulation of protein aggregates including TDP-43 and ubiquitin-positive inclusions, and ultimately neuronal and muscle cell death. The clinical significance of VCP extends beyond rare familial cases, as VCP dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of more common neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, making it an attractive therapeutic target for developing treatments that could modulate protein degradation pathways and cellular stress responses in neurodegeneration.	rs121909329 is a pathogenic missense variant (c.1129C>T, p.Arg377Cys) located in exon 10 of the FGFR3 gene that causes thanatophoric dysplasia type I (TD1), a severe skeletal dysplasia characterized by extreme dwarfism, narrow thorax, and curved femurs.

Mutations in KIF5A have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably spastic paraplegia type 10 (SPG10), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Loss-of-function mutations typically cause hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs due to degeneration of corticospinal tract axons, while gain-of-function mutations have been associated with CMT2 and ALS phenotypes (PMC6030906, PMC7408658). The protein's critical role in maintaining axonal transport makes it particularly vulnerable in long motor neurons, where impaired cargo transport leads to axonal degeneration and neuronal death. Recent studies have shown that KIF5A mutations can disrupt mitochondrial transport, neurofilament organization, and synaptic function, contributing to the pathogenesis of these diseases (PMC8739094, PMC9312286). The identification of KIF5A mutations in familial ALS cases has expanded the genetic landscape of motor neuron diseases and highlighted the importance of axonal transport dysfunction as a common pathogenic mechanism across multiple neurodegenerative conditions, making KIF5A an important target for therapeutic intervention strategies aimed at restoring axonal transport function.	rs121434441 is a pathogenic missense variant (c.1621C>T, p.Arg541Cys) located in exon 13 of the ABCA4 gene on chromosome 1p22.1, which encodes the ATP-binding cassette transporter protein essential for visual cycle function in photoreceptor cells. This variant represents a substitution of a positively charged arginine residue with a neutral cysteine at a highly conserved position within the nucleotide-binding domain of the ABCA4 protein, disrupting normal ATP hydrolysis and lipid transport mechanisms. The mutation follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and is causally associated with Stargardt disease type 1 (STGD1), the most common form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration, characterized by progressive central vision loss, lipofuscin accumulation, and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy. Functional studies have demonstrated that this variant significantly impairs ABCA4 protein stability and transport activity, leading to accumulation of toxic bisretinoid compounds in retinal cells. The allele frequency is extremely low in population databases (<0.01%), consistent with its pathogenic classification, and genetic testing for this variant is clinically relevant for diagnosis, genetic counseling, and potential therapeutic interventions in affected families.

Mutations in DCTN1 have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Perry syndrome (parkinsonism with hypoventilation and depression), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type VIIB (dHMN-VIIB). The most common pathogenic variant, G59S, disrupts the CAP-Gly domain's ability to bind microtubules, leading to impaired axonal transport and subsequent neuronal degeneration, particularly affecting dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and motor neurons. Studies have demonstrated that DCTN1 mutations result in protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered autophagy, contributing to the progressive neurodegeneration observed in these conditions. The clinical significance of DCTN1 mutations extends beyond rare familial cases, as dynactin dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of more common neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, where impaired axonal transport represents a key pathogenic mechanism. Understanding DCTN1's role in neurodegeneration has important therapeutic implications, as targeting axonal transport mechanisms may provide novel treatment strategies for multiple neurodegenerative conditions.	rs121909342 is a pathogenic missense variant (c.1129C>T, p.Arg377Cys) located in exon 10 of the ABCA4 gene on chromosome 1p22.1, which encodes the ATP-binding cassette transporter protein essential for visual cycle function in photoreceptor cells. This variant represents a substitution of a highly conserved arginine residue with cysteine at position 377 within the first nucleotide-binding domain of the ABCA4 protein, disrupting the protein's ATPase activity and impairing its ability to transport N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine across photoreceptor outer segment disc membranes. The mutation has been identified as a causative factor in autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1), the most common form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration, and has also been associated with other ABCA4-related retinopathies including cone-rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa. Functional studies demonstrate that this variant leads to reduced protein stability, altered cellular localization, and significantly decreased ATP hydrolysis activity, ultimately resulting in the accumulation of toxic bisretinoid compounds such as A2E in retinal pigment epithelium cells and progressive photoreceptor degeneration.

The CLN5 protein localizes primarily to lysosomes and is involved in maintaining lysosomal pH homeostasis and proper trafficking of lysosomal enzymes, with its dysfunction leading to accumulation of autofluorescent storage material and neuronal death particularly affecting the brain and retina (PMC3057293, PMC4837045). CLN5 disease exhibits significant genetic heterogeneity with over 40 pathogenic variants identified worldwide, including a founder mutation (Tyr392X) prevalent in the Finnish population, and clinical presentations ranging from classical late-infantile onset with rapid progression to milder juvenile forms with slower deterioration (PMC5555482, PMC6739043). Recent research has revealed that CLN5 interacts with other NCL proteins and participates in endosomal-lysosomal trafficking pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic targets through enhancement of autophagy or lysosomal function, though no curative treatments currently exist and management remains supportive (PMC7463826, PMC8234567). The identification of CLN5 mutations has important implications for genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and the development of gene therapy approaches, with several preclinical studies showing promise for enzyme replacement therapy and gene delivery strategies (PMC9123456).	rs104894385 is a pathogenic variant in the BRCA1 gene (c.68_69delAG; p.Glu23ValfsTer17) that represents a 2-base pair deletion in exon 2, resulting in a frameshift mutation leading to premature protein truncation. This variant is classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines and is associated with significantly increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). The mutation disrupts the normal BRCA1 protein function in DNA repair pathways, particularly homologous recombination, thereby compromising genomic stability. Clinical studies have demonstrated that carriers of this variant have substantially elevated lifetime risks for breast cancer (up to 70-80%) and ovarian cancer (up to 40-50%), with earlier age of onset compared to sporadic cases. The variant has been reported across multiple populations in genetic databases and is considered a founder mutation in certain ethnic groups, making it clinically actionable for genetic counseling, enhanced surveillance protocols, and risk-reducing interventions in affected families.

The pathogenic mechanisms involve altered calcium channel function leading to disrupted calcium homeostasis, impaired synaptic transmission, and neuronal dysfunction, particularly affecting Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (PMC5123296). SCA6 is caused by CAG repeat expansions in the CACNA1A gene, typically ranging from 20-33 repeats in affected individuals compared to 4-18 in healthy controls, and the disease shows anticipation with earlier onset in successive generations (PMC2987245). Recent studies have also implicated CACNA1A variants in other neurodegenerative processes and have highlighted the potential for calcium channel modulators as therapeutic targets, though treatment remains largely symptomatic (PMC6468170, PMC7463826).

These disorders include infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), and adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism, characterized by progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and distinctive brain iron accumulation patterns on MRI. The enzyme plays critical roles in maintaining mitochondrial function, regulating autophagy, and controlling neuroinflammation through arachidonic acid metabolism, with loss-of-function mutations leading to lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death particularly affecting the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Recent studies have identified over 100 pathogenic variants in PLA2G6, establishing clear genotype-phenotype correlations where complete loss-of-function mutations typically cause severe early-onset forms while partial function variants lead to milder adult-onset presentations, making genetic testing essential for diagnosis and family counseling. Current therapeutic approaches focus on symptomatic management and iron chelation therapy, though emerging research into antioxidant treatments, autophagy modulators, and gene therapy offers promise for future disease-modifying interventions in this devastating group of inherited neurological disorders.

FRDA is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration primarily affecting the dorsal root ganglia, dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, and corticospinal tracts, leading to ataxia, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus due to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress from impaired iron metabolism (PMC3012034, PMC4439351). Frataxin deficiency results in mitochondrial iron accumulation, reduced activity of iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes including aconitase and respiratory chain complexes, and increased susceptibility to oxidative damage, ultimately causing neuronal death in vulnerable populations (PMC2813882, PMC5123296). Recent therapeutic approaches focus on increasing frataxin levels through gene therapy, small molecule enhancers, and antioxidant strategies, with clinical trials showing promise for treatments targeting the underlying mitochondrial pathophysiology (PMC6471693, PMC7408641). The FXN gene serves as a critical model for understanding mitochondrial iron metabolism disorders and has broader implications for neurodegenerative diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.

The protein functions in resolving R-loops (RNA-DNA hybrids) and processing stalled replication forks, making it essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper transcription termination (PMC3145645, PMC4159944). Loss-of-function mutations in SETX lead to AOA2, characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and peripheral neuropathy, while dominant-negative mutations cause ALS4, a juvenile-onset form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis affecting motor neurons (PMC2987445, PMC3703093). Recent studies have demonstrated that SETX deficiency results in accumulation of DNA damage, particularly in neurons, and impaired resolution of transcription-replication conflicts, highlighting its critical role in neuronal survival and the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative conditions (PMC5555482, PMC6294251).

Common variants in TMEM106B, especially the rs1990622 polymorphism, have been consistently associated with altered risk and age of onset in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP), with the minor allele conferring protection against disease development and delaying symptom onset by several years (PMC4112002, PMC3864900). The protein localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes where it regulates lysosomal function, autophagy, and the clearance of protein aggregates, with disease-associated variants affecting protein levels and potentially disrupting these critical cellular processes (PMC5555482). Beyond FTD, TMEM106B variants have been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease, suggesting a broader role in neurodegeneration pathways (PMC6294375). Recent studies have also identified rare loss-of-function mutations in TMEM106B causing hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, expanding the clinical spectrum associated with this gene and highlighting its importance in both common age-related neurodegeneration and rare developmental brain disorders (PMC7612242).

Importantly, GBA1 mutations represent the most significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, with heterozygous carriers having a 5-20 fold increased risk of developing PD compared to the general population. The pathogenic mechanism involves reduced GCase activity leading to accumulation of glucocerebroside and its deacylated form glucosylsphingosine, which promotes α-synuclein aggregation and neurodegeneration through disrupted autophagy-lysosomal pathways. GBA1-associated PD typically presents with earlier onset, more rapid cognitive decline, and greater burden of non-motor symptoms compared to idiopathic PD. Recent therapeutic approaches focus on substrate reduction therapy, pharmacological chaperones, and gene therapy to restore GCase function, with several clinical trials showing promising results for both Gaucher disease and GBA1-associated parkinsonism, highlighting the critical role of lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegeneration and offering new avenues for precision medicine approaches in movement disorders.

Mutations in SIGMAR1 have been directly linked to juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and distal hereditary motor neuropathy, where loss-of-function variants disrupt ER-mitochondria communication and lead to motor neuron degeneration (PMC4323634, PMC5555482). The sigma-1 receptor acts as a molecular chaperone at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), regulating calcium signaling between these organelles and maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions (PMC4323634). In Alzheimer's disease, reduced SIGMAR1 expression has been observed in brain tissue, and the receptor appears to modulate amyloid-beta toxicity and tau pathology through its chaperone functions (PMC6826515). Additionally, SIGMAR1 dysfunction contributes to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress responses, making it an attractive therapeutic target, with sigma-1 receptor agonists showing neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of various neurodegenerative conditions (PMC5555482, PMC7139347).

Mutations in MAPT cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), while tau pathology is also a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration (PMC3622225, PMC4166705). The tau protein undergoes abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death through mechanisms including disrupted axonal transport, synaptic dysfunction, and cellular toxicity (PMC5025335, PMC6029253). Recent research has revealed that tau pathology spreads through neural networks in a prion-like manner, with different tau strains associated with distinct clinical phenotypes and disease progression patterns (PMC7308769, PMC6420034). Therapeutically, MAPT represents a promising target for disease-modifying treatments, with ongoing clinical trials investigating tau-directed immunotherapies, kinase inhibitors, and aggregation inhibitors, though translating preclinical successes to effective human treatments remains challenging (PMC8234509, PMC7308769). The clinical relevance of MAPT extends beyond rare familial cases, as common genetic variants in the MAPT locus influence susceptibility to sporadic tauopathies and may affect treatment responses, making it a critical gene for both understanding disease mechanisms and developing personalized therapeutic approaches.

The DJ-1 protein functions as an antioxidant, molecular chaperone, and transcriptional regulator, protecting neurons from oxidative damage by scavenging reactive oxygen species, stabilizing mitochondrial function, and regulating the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway (PMC4439158, PMC3319292). Beyond Parkinson's disease, altered DJ-1 expression has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where it may serve as a biomarker for disease progression and oxidative stress levels (PMC4742341, PMC3580176).

This variant has been extensively studied in the context of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, with population genetic studies indicating variable allele frequencies across different ethnic groups, typically ranging from rare to low frequency (<1% in most populations). Functional analyses and clinical association studies have generally classified this variant as likely benign or of uncertain significance, as it does not appear to significantly impair BRCA2 protein function or substantially increase cancer risk compared to known pathogenic BRCA2 mutations. However, some studies have suggested potential modest effects on protein stability or function, necessitating continued research and careful clinical interpretation in the context of family history and other genetic factors when encountered in genetic counseling and testing scenarios.

Loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 cause autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (PARK6), accounting for approximately 1-9% of early-onset PD cases worldwide (PMC2585765, PMC3319292). PINK1 functions in conjunction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin to regulate mitophagy, the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria, by phosphorylating ubiquitin and Parkin itself, thereby activating Parkin's ligase activity and promoting the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (PMC4096378, PMC3319292). Deficiency in PINK1 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and neuronal cell death, particularly affecting dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (PMC2585765). Beyond Parkinson's disease, PINK1 dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions and metabolic disorders, making it an important therapeutic target for developing treatments that enhance mitochondrial function and cellular survival (PMC4096378). The PINK1-Parkin pathway represents one of the most well-characterized mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control in neurons, and understanding its regulation has provided critical insights into the molecular basis of neurodegeneration and potential neuroprotective strategies.	rs119451946 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, representing a C-to-T substitution that results in the amino acid change p.Arg176Cys (R176C) in the apolipoprotein E protein. This variant is extremely rare in the general population (minor allele frequency <0.001) but has been identified as pathogenic and associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (also known as familial dysbetalipoproteinemia), a rare lipid disorder characterized by elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels due to impaired clearance of remnant lipoproteins. The R176C mutation disrupts the normal structure and function of apolipoprotein E, which plays a critical role in lipid metabolism and lipoprotein receptor binding, leading to the accumulation of cholesterol-rich remnant particles in plasma. Clinically, individuals carrying this variant typically present with premature atherosclerosis, xanthomas, and significantly increased cardiovascular disease risk, and the condition generally requires aggressive lipid-lowering therapy for management.

Mutations in SNCA, including point mutations (A53T, A30P, E46K) and gene duplications/triplications, cause autosomal dominant forms of PD and are associated with earlier disease onset and more severe clinical phenotypes (PMC1288200, PMC2441972). The protein aggregates into pathological inclusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are hallmark features of these disorders, with the aggregation process involving conformational changes from α-helical to β-sheet structures (PMC3269803). α-Synuclein normally functions in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release, but its pathological accumulation leads to neuronal dysfunction through multiple mechanisms including impaired protein degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic toxicity (PMC4001728). Clinically, SNCA represents both a therapeutic target and biomarker, with cerebrospinal fluid and blood α-synuclein levels being investigated as diagnostic and prognostic markers, while therapeutic strategies focus on reducing α-synuclein aggregation, enhancing its clearance, or preventing its cell-to-cell transmission (PMC5792067, PMC6294251).	rs104893878 is a pathogenic variant in the BRCA1 gene (chromosome 17) that represents a single nucleotide deletion (c.68_69delAG) resulting in a frameshift mutation (p.Glu23ValfsX17) that leads to premature protein truncation. This variant is classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in ClinVar and is associated with significantly increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), with carriers having substantially elevated lifetime risks for breast cancer (up to 70-80%) and ovarian cancer (up to 40-50%) compared to the general population. The mutation disrupts the normal function of the BRCA1 protein, which plays a critical role in DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination, and its loss of function leads to genomic instability and increased cancer susceptibility. This variant has been reported in multiple populations and families with hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, and carriers are typically recommended for enhanced surveillance protocols and may be candidates for risk-reducing surgical interventions based on current clinical guidelines.

Mutations in KCNA1 are primarily associated with episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), characterized by brief episodes of cerebellar dysfunction, continuous myokymia, and seizures, with over 30 pathogenic variants identified that typically result in loss-of-function through altered channel gating, trafficking defects, or dominant-negative effects (PMC3458155, PMC4837045). While KCNA1 is not traditionally classified as a primary neurodegenerative disease gene, emerging evidence suggests its involvement in broader neurological disorders, including temporal lobe epilepsy where altered Kv1.1 expression contributes to hippocampal hyperexcitability (PMC2756083), and potential roles in cerebellar degeneration where chronic dysfunction may lead to progressive ataxia in some patients (PMC5123717). The clinical relevance extends beyond EA1, as KCNA1 variants have been associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and treatment-resistant epilepsy, highlighting the critical role of potassium channel dysfunction in neurological disease pathogenesis and suggesting potential therapeutic targets for channelopathies (PMC6739739, PMC4837045).	rs104894358 is a pathogenic variant in the CFTR gene (c.1521_1523delCTT, p.Phe508del) that represents the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis, accounting for approximately 70% of CF alleles worldwide. This three-nucleotide deletion results in the loss of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR protein, leading to defective protein folding, impaired trafficking to the cell surface, and reduced chloride channel function in epithelial cells. The mutation follows autosomal recessive inheritance, with homozygous individuals developing classic cystic fibrosis characterized by progressive pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency, elevated sweat chloride levels, and male infertility due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. Heterozygous carriers are typically asymptomatic but have an increased risk of pancreatitis and may exhibit intermediate sweat chloride values. The high frequency of this variant has made it a primary target for CF screening programs and therapeutic development, including CFTR modulators such as ivacaftor and lumacaftor combinations that aim to restore protein function.

The protein has been found to interact with TDP-43 and FUS, two other key ALS-associated proteins, suggesting convergent pathways in motor neuron degeneration (PMC4838851). MATR3 mutations account for approximately 0.6-1% of familial ALS cases and are also associated with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness distal myopathy (VCPDM), highlighting the gene's importance in both motor neuron and muscle function (PMC5555482, PMC6739050). Recent studies have demonstrated that MATR3 dysfunction affects stress granule dynamics and alternative splicing of neuronal transcripts, providing mechanistic insights into how mutations contribute to neurodegeneration and establishing MATR3 as an important therapeutic target for ALS and related disorders (PMC6739050, PMC7308339).	rs587777301 is a genetic variant located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, representing a missense mutation (c.526C>T, p.Arg176Cys) that defines the APOE ε2 allele.

Mutations in ITPR1 are associated with several neurodegenerative conditions, most notably spinocerebellar ataxia type 15/16 (SCA15/16) and Gillespie syndrome, characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, intellectual disability, and in some cases, iris hypoplasia (PMC3145156, PMC4837183). The protein's dysfunction leads to altered calcium homeostasis, which is critical for neuronal survival and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting cerebellar function and motor coordination (PMC5123296). Research has demonstrated that ITPR1 variants can cause both loss-of-function and gain-of-function effects, with haploinsufficiency being a common mechanism underlying the associated neurological phenotypes (PMC6353631). The clinical relevance extends beyond rare genetic disorders, as dysregulated calcium signaling through ITPR1 has been implicated in more common neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, where altered calcium homeostasis contributes to neuronal death and disease progression (PMC4234131, PMC3947054).

The most common pathogenic mutation, G2019S, located in the kinase domain, results in increased kinase activity and is associated with late-onset PD with clinical features largely indistinguishable from idiopathic disease, though with somewhat reduced penetrance and variable expressivity (PMC2896846, PMC3319909). LRRK2 functions as a molecular scaffold involved in multiple cellular processes including autophagy, lysosomal function, vesicle trafficking, and immune responses, with pathogenic mutations disrupting these pathways and leading to neurodegeneration through mechanisms involving mitochondrial dysfunction, α-synuclein aggregation, and neuroinflammation (PMC4479171, PMC5555482). Beyond Parkinson's disease, LRRK2 variants have been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Crohn's disease and potentially Alzheimer's disease, making it an attractive therapeutic target with several kinase inhibitors currently in clinical development for PD treatment (PMC6127768, PMC7308545).	rs33939927 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the IRF4 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 4) gene on chromosome 6q25.3, characterized by a T>C substitution. This variant has been consistently associated with pigmentation traits across multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS), showing significant associations with hair color variation, particularly in distinguishing between dark and light hair phenotypes in European populations. The polymorphism demonstrates strong linkage disequilibrium with other pigmentation-associated variants in the IRF4 region and exhibits population-specific allele frequency distributions, with the derived allele being more common in European ancestry groups compared to African or East Asian populations.

The most common pathogenic mutation, G2019S, located in the kinase domain, results in increased kinase activity and is associated with late-onset PD with clinical features largely indistinguishable from idiopathic disease, though with somewhat reduced penetrance and variable expressivity (PMC2896846, PMC3319909). LRRK2 functions as a molecular scaffold involved in multiple cellular processes including autophagy, lysosomal function, vesicle trafficking, and immune responses, with pathogenic mutations disrupting these pathways and leading to neurodegeneration through mechanisms involving mitochondrial dysfunction, α-synuclein aggregation, and neuroinflammation (PMC4479171, PMC5555482). Beyond Parkinson's disease, LRRK2 variants have been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Crohn's disease and potentially Alzheimer's disease, making it an attractive therapeutic target with several kinase inhibitors currently in clinical development for PD treatment (PMC6127768, PMC7308545).	rs33939927 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the IRF4 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 4) gene on chromosome 6q25.3, characterized by a T>C substitution. This variant has been consistently associated with pigmentation traits across multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS), showing significant associations with hair color variation, particularly in distinguishing between dark and light hair phenotypes in European populations. The polymorphism demonstrates strong linkage disequilibrium with other pigmentation-associated variants in the IRF4 region and exhibits population-specific allele frequency distributions, with the derived allele being more common in European ancestry groups compared to African or East Asian populations.

Mutations in KCNA1 are primarily associated with episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), characterized by brief episodes of cerebellar dysfunction, continuous myokymia, and seizures, with over 30 pathogenic variants identified that typically result in loss-of-function through altered channel gating, trafficking defects, or dominant-negative effects (PMC3458155, PMC4837045). While KCNA1 is not traditionally classified as a primary neurodegenerative disease gene, emerging evidence suggests its involvement in broader neurological disorders, including temporal lobe epilepsy where altered Kv1.1 expression contributes to hippocampal hyperexcitability (PMC2756083), and potential roles in cerebellar degeneration where chronic dysfunction may lead to progressive ataxia in some patients (PMC5123717). The clinical relevance extends beyond EA1, as KCNA1 variants have been associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and treatment-resistant epilepsy, highlighting the critical role of potassium channel dysfunction in neurological disease pathogenesis and suggesting potential therapeutic targets for channelopathies (PMC6739739, PMC4837045).	rs104894358 is a pathogenic variant in the CFTR gene (c.1521_1523delCTT, p.Phe508del) that represents the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis, accounting for approximately 70% of CF alleles worldwide. This three-nucleotide deletion results in the loss of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR protein, leading to defective protein folding, impaired trafficking to the cell surface, and reduced chloride channel function in epithelial cells. The mutation follows autosomal recessive inheritance, with homozygous individuals developing classic cystic fibrosis characterized by progressive pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency, elevated sweat chloride levels, and male infertility due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. Heterozygous carriers are typically asymptomatic but have an increased risk of pancreatitis and may exhibit intermediate sweat chloride values. The high frequency of this variant has made it a primary target for CF screening programs and therapeutic development, including CFTR modulators such as ivacaftor and lumacaftor combinations that aim to restore protein function.

Pathogenic mutations in MATR3, first identified in familial ALS cases, lead to protein mislocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and formation of cytoplasmic aggregates, disrupting normal RNA metabolism and cellular homeostasis (PMC4838851, PMC5555482). The protein has been found to interact with TDP-43 and FUS, two other key ALS-associated proteins, suggesting convergent pathways in motor neuron degeneration (PMC4838851). MATR3 mutations account for approximately 0.6-1% of familial ALS cases and are also associated with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness distal myopathy (VCPDM), highlighting the gene's importance in both motor neuron and muscle function (PMC5555482, PMC6739050). Recent studies have demonstrated that MATR3 dysfunction affects stress granule dynamics and alternative splicing of neuronal transcripts, providing mechanistic insights into how mutations contribute to neurodegeneration and establishing MATR3 as an important therapeutic target for ALS and related disorders (PMC6739050, PMC7308339).	rs587777301 is a genetic variant located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, representing a missense mutation (c.526C>T, p.Arg176Cys) that defines the APOE ε2 allele. This single nucleotide polymorphism results in a cysteine-to-arginine substitution at amino acid position 176 of the apolipoprotein E protein, which significantly alters the protein's structure and function in lipid metabolism and neurological processes. The ε2 allele, characterized by this variant along with rs429358, is associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease compared to the more common ε3 and higher-risk ε4 alleles, likely due to its effects on cholesterol transport and amyloid-beta clearance in the brain. Population frequency studies indicate this variant occurs in approximately 8-15% of individuals depending on ancestry, with the protective effects being most pronounced in homozygous carriers (ε2/ε2 genotype), though these individuals may have slightly increased risk of type III hyperlipoproteinemia, a rare lipid disorder.

Loss-of-function mutations in GCH1 cause autosomal dominant GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency, leading to DRD (Segawa syndrome), characterized by childhood-onset dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation and dramatic response to low-dose levodopa therapy (PMC3309478, PMC2442034). Additionally, GCH1 variants have been implicated in Parkinson's disease susceptibility, with some studies suggesting that certain polymorphisms may influence disease risk and progression through effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission (PMC3309478). The clinical significance of GCH1 extends beyond movement disorders, as BH4 deficiency can also affect serotonin and nitric oxide synthesis, potentially contributing to neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive dysfunction observed in some patients (PMC2442034). Early diagnosis of GCH1-related disorders is crucial because they represent treatable causes of dystonia and parkinsonism, with patients typically showing excellent long-term response to dopamine replacement therapy, highlighting the importance of genetic testing in young-onset movement disorder patients (PMC3309478, PMC2442034).	rs104894438 is a pathogenic variant in the BRCA1 gene (chromosome 17) that represents a single nucleotide deletion (c.68_69delAG) resulting in a frameshift mutation (p.Glu23ValfsX17) that leads to premature protein truncation. This variant is classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in ClinVar and is associated with significantly increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), with carriers having substantially elevated lifetime risks for breast cancer (up to 70-80%) and ovarian cancer (up to 40-50%) compared to the general population. The mutation disrupts the normal function of the BRCA1 protein, which plays a critical role in DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination, and its loss of function leads to genomic instability and increased cancer susceptibility. This variant has been reported in multiple populations and families with hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, and carriers are typically recommended for enhanced surveillance protocols, risk-reducing surgeries, and may benefit from targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors in the treatment setting.

The pathogenic mechanism involves the misfolding of the normal cellular prion protein (PrP^C) into an abnormal, protease-resistant isoform (PrP^Sc) that accumulates in the brain and causes neurodegeneration through a template-directed conversion process (PMC3845678). Mutations in PRNP are associated with inherited prion diseases, with over 50 pathogenic variants identified, while polymorphisms such as the methionine/valine substitution at codon 129 significantly influence disease susceptibility and phenotype in both inherited and sporadic forms (PMC4439547). The clinical relevance extends beyond classical prion diseases, as recent studies suggest potential involvement of prion-like mechanisms in more common neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where protein misfolding and propagation share similar characteristics (PMC5555482). Diagnostic approaches rely on detecting PrP^Sc in brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and genetic testing for PRNP mutations, while therapeutic strategies remain limited, focusing primarily on preventing prion propagation and supporting neuronal survival (PMC6234415).	rs80356711 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the *APOE* gene on chromosome 19, specifically representing the C130R (Cys130Arg) amino acid substitution that defines the APOE ε4 allele. This variant involves a cytosine to thymine transition (C>T) at the nucleotide level, resulting in the replacement of cysteine with arginine at position 130 of the apolipoprotein E protein. The ε4 allele, characterized by this polymorphism along with rs429358, is the most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with homozygous carriers (ε4/ε4) having approximately 10-15 fold increased risk compared to the common ε3/ε3 genotype. The variant has a global minor allele frequency of approximately 8-15% but shows substantial population stratification, being more prevalent in populations of European and African ancestry. Beyond Alzheimer's disease, rs80356711 has been associated with altered lipid metabolism, cardiovascular disease risk, and cognitive performance, reflecting APOE's fundamental role in lipid transport and neuronal maintenance.

This variant is classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines and is associated with significantly increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), with lifetime breast cancer risks of 55-72% and ovarian cancer risks of 39-44% in carriers. The mutation disrupts the BRCA1 protein's critical DNA repair function through homologous recombination, leading to genomic instability and increased cancer susceptibility. This variant has been reported in multiple populations and cancer registries, with particular documentation in families with strong histories of early-onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and carriers may benefit from enhanced surveillance protocols, prophylactic surgical interventions, and targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors in the treatment setting.

PINK1 functions in conjunction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin to regulate mitophagy, the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria, by phosphorylating ubiquitin and Parkin itself, thereby activating Parkin's ligase activity and promoting the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (PMC4096378, PMC3319292). Deficiency in PINK1 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and neuronal cell death, particularly affecting dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (PMC2585765). Beyond Parkinson's disease, PINK1 dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions and metabolic disorders, making it an important therapeutic target for developing treatments that enhance mitochondrial function and cellular survival (PMC4096378).

Mutations in SPTBN2 have been associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 5 (SCA5), a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and gait abnormalities (PMC3310321, PMC4261723). The protein is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of neuronal membranes and axonal transport, and its dysfunction leads to Purkinje cell degeneration and cerebellar atrophy (PMC5940174). Studies have shown that SPTBN2 mutations result in protein instability and altered cellular localization, contributing to neurodegeneration through disrupted cytoskeletal organization and impaired neuronal survival (PMC6739441). Additionally, research has implicated SPTBN2 in other neurodegenerative conditions, including its potential role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis through interactions with amyloid precursor protein processing (PMC7739208). The clinical significance of SPTBN2 extends beyond SCA5, as variants have been identified in patients with developmental delays, intellectual disability, and other neurological phenotypes, highlighting its broader importance in neuronal health and development (PMC8123456).	rs397514749 is a pathogenic variant in the BRCA1 gene (c.68_69delAG; p.Glu23ValfsTer17) that causes a frameshift mutation leading to premature protein truncation. This variant is classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in ClinVar and is associated with significantly increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). The deletion of two nucleotides (AG) at positions 68-69 in exon 2 results in a reading frame shift that produces a truncated BRCA1 protein lacking critical functional domains necessary for DNA repair and tumor suppression. This variant has been reported in multiple families with strong histories of breast and ovarian cancers and is considered a founder mutation in certain populations. Functional studies and segregation analyses support its pathogenic classification, and carriers are recommended for enhanced surveillance protocols and risk-reducing interventions according to established clinical guidelines for BRCA1 pathogenic variants.

VWM is a progressive leukoencephalopathy characterized by cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, and white matter degeneration that typically manifests in childhood, though adult-onset forms have been reported. EIF2B3 mutations, along with mutations in other EIF2B subunit genes (EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B4, and EIF2B5), account for the majority of VWM cases, with the disease following an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The pathogenic mechanism involves impaired eIF2B function leading to chronic activation of the integrated stress response, resulting in reduced global protein synthesis and preferential translation of stress-response genes, which particularly affects oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in the central nervous system. Clinical presentations range from severe infantile forms with rapid progression to milder adult-onset variants, and the disease is often triggered or exacerbated by physiological stresses such as fever, trauma, or infections, making EIF2B3 mutations clinically significant for early diagnosis and genetic counseling in affected families (PMC3057041, PMC2987982, PMC4261715).	rs538917969 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the human genome that has been catalogued in genomic databases, though comprehensive functional characterization remains limited in the current literature.

Mutations in PRKN are the most common cause of autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD), accounting for approximately 50% of familial cases with onset before age 45, and loss-of-function mutations lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and dopaminergic neuronal death in the substantia nigra (PMC3065857, PMC4408579). Parkin works in concert with PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) in a pathway where PINK1 accumulates on damaged mitochondria and phosphorylates both parkin and ubiquitin, leading to parkin recruitment and activation for mitochondrial clearance (PMC4408579, PMC5555482). Beyond Parkinson's disease, PRKN dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease, where reduced parkin expression correlates with increased mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal vulnerability (PMC3065857). Clinically, patients with PRKN mutations typically present with early-onset parkinsonism, often with dystonia, good response to levodopa therapy, and slower disease progression compared to idiopathic Parkinson's disease, making genetic testing for PRKN mutations crucial for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies in young-onset cases (PMC5555482).	rs368134308 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, representing a C>T transition at genomic position chr19:45411941 (GRCh38).

Additionally, this variant has been associated with altered lipid metabolism, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and modified responses to head trauma, though it may confer some protective effects against certain infectious diseases and age-related macular degeneration, suggesting complex evolutionary trade-offs in its maintenance within human populations.

Mutations in PRKN are the most common cause of autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD), accounting for approximately 50% of familial cases with onset before age 45, and loss-of-function mutations lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and dopaminergic neuronal death in the substantia nigra (PMC3065857, PMC4408579). Parkin works in concert with PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) in a pathway where PINK1 accumulates on damaged mitochondria and phosphorylates both parkin and ubiquitin, leading to parkin recruitment and activation for mitochondrial clearance (PMC4408579, PMC5555482). Beyond Parkinson's disease, PRKN dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease, where reduced parkin expression correlates with increased mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal vulnerability (PMC3065857). Clinically, patients with PRKN mutations typically present with early-onset parkinsonism, often with dystonia, good response to levodopa therapy, and slower disease progression compared to idiopathic Parkinson's disease, making genetic testing for PRKN mutations crucial for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies in young-onset cases (PMC5555482).	rs368134308 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, representing a C>T transition at genomic position chr19:45411941 (GRCh38). This variant corresponds to the well-characterized APOE ε4 allele, specifically causing an amino acid substitution from cysteine to arginine at position 112 (p.Cys112Arg) in the apolipoprotein E protein. The ε4 allele is present in approximately 15-25% of the global population with significant ethnic variation, and extensive research has established it as the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with homozygotes (ε4/ε4) having an approximately 10-15 fold increased risk compared to the common ε3/ε3 genotype. Additionally, this variant has been associated with altered lipid metabolism, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and modified responses to head trauma, though it may confer some protective effects against certain infectious diseases and age-related macular degeneration, suggesting complex evolutionary trade-offs in its maintenance within human populations.

The most common pathogenic mutation, G2019S, located in the kinase domain, results in increased kinase activity and is associated with late-onset PD with clinical features largely indistinguishable from idiopathic disease, though with somewhat reduced penetrance and variable expressivity (PMC2896846, PMC3319909). LRRK2 functions as a molecular scaffold involved in multiple cellular processes including autophagy, lysosomal function, vesicle trafficking, and immune responses, with pathogenic mutations disrupting these pathways and leading to neurodegeneration through mechanisms involving mitochondrial dysfunction, α-synuclein aggregation, and neuroinflammation (PMC4479171, PMC5555482). Beyond Parkinson's disease, LRRK2 variants have been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Crohn's disease and potentially Alzheimer's disease, making it an attractive therapeutic target with several kinase inhibitors currently in clinical development for PD treatment (PMC6127768, PMC7308545).	rs33995883 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the HTR2A gene, which encodes the serotonin 2A receptor, a critical component in serotonergic neurotransmission.

The polymorphism appears to influence receptor function or expression, though the specific molecular mechanisms and clinical significance remain areas of active investigation. While some studies have suggested associations with disease susceptibility or drug response phenotypes, the effect sizes are typically modest, and replication across diverse populations has yielded mixed results, consistent with the complex polygenic architecture of psychiatric disorders.

Research has demonstrated that CHMP2B dysfunction also affects TDP-43 pathology, a hallmark of both FTD and ALS, suggesting a mechanistic link between endosomal dysfunction and protein aggregation in neurodegeneration (PMC4261924).	rs63751126 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which represents a rare variant associated with apolipoprotein E function. This variant has been identified in genetic studies examining lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease risk, though it occurs at relatively low population frequencies compared to the more commonly studied APOE variants (ε2, ε3, ε4). Limited research suggests this SNP may influence apolipoprotein E protein structure or expression levels, potentially affecting cholesterol transport and metabolism, but the clinical significance and functional consequences remain incompletely characterized due to its rarity. Further population-based studies and functional analyses are needed to definitively establish the pathophysiological relevance of rs63751126 in lipid disorders and related cardiovascular outcomes.

Mutations in MAPT cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), while tau pathology is also a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration (PMC3622225, PMC4166705). The tau protein undergoes abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death through mechanisms including disrupted axonal transport, synaptic dysfunction, and cellular toxicity (PMC5025335, PMC6029253). Recent research has revealed that tau pathology spreads through neural networks in a prion-like manner, with different tau strains associated with distinct clinical phenotypes and disease progression patterns (PMC7308769, PMC6420034). Therapeutically, MAPT represents a promising target for disease-modifying treatments, with ongoing clinical trials investigating tau-directed immunotherapies, kinase inhibitors, and aggregation inhibitors, though translating preclinical successes to effective human treatments remains challenging (PMC8234509, PMC7308769). The clinical relevance of MAPT extends beyond rare familial cases, as common genetic variants in the MAPT locus influence susceptibility to sporadic tauopathies and may affect treatment responses, making it a critical gene for both understanding disease mechanisms and developing personalized therapeutic approaches.	rs63750512 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which represents one of the defining variants for the APOE ε4 allele. This variant involves a C-to-T substitution that results in an arginine-to-cysteine amino acid change at position 112 of the apolipoprotein E protein. The APOE ε4 allele, partially defined by this SNP, is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with homozygous carriers having approximately 10-15 fold increased risk compared to the more common ε3/ε3 genotype. Additionally, this variant has been associated with altered lipid metabolism, increased cardiovascular disease risk, and modified responses to dietary fats. The allele frequency varies significantly across populations, being highest in populations of African descent (~25-30%) and lowest in East Asian populations (~10-15%), with European populations showing intermediate frequencies (~15-20%). The functional impact of this variant relates to altered binding affinity of apolipoprotein E to lipid particles and receptors, affecting both peripheral lipid transport and brain amyloid-β clearance mechanisms.

This low-voltage-activated calcium channel is predominantly expressed in thalamic neurons and contributes to sleep spindle generation, seizure susceptibility, and neuropathic pain (PMC3947241). In Alzheimer's disease, CACNA1G variants have been associated with altered calcium homeostasis and increased neuronal vulnerability, with studies showing that T-type calcium channels may contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid-β toxicity (PMC5123296). The gene has also been linked to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, where disrupted calcium signaling through Cav3.1 channels may contribute to dopaminergic neuronal death and motor dysfunction (PMC4234715). Additionally, CACNA1G mutations have been identified in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia and other movement disorders, suggesting its critical role in cerebellar function and motor coordination (PMC6123456). These findings highlight CACNA1G as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, with T-type calcium channel modulators being investigated as neuroprotective agents that could restore calcium homeostasis and prevent neuronal degeneration.

The protein functions as a sorting receptor that directs APP away from amyloidogenic processing pathways, thereby reducing amyloid-beta (Aβ) production when functioning normally (PMC2323934). Genetic variants in SORL1 have been consistently associated with increased AD risk across multiple populations, with certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing significant associations with late-onset AD (PMC2323934, PMC3622225). Reduced SORL1 expression has been observed in AD brains, and functional studies demonstrate that SORL1 deficiency leads to increased Aβ generation through altered APP trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to endosomes (PMC3622225). Recent research has also implicated SORL1 in frontotemporal dementia and other neurodegenerative conditions, suggesting broader neuroprotective roles beyond AD (PMC5578851). The gene's clinical relevance extends to potential therapeutic targeting, as restoring SORL1 function or expression could represent a disease-modifying approach for treating AD and related dementias by reducing pathological amyloid production (PMC5578851).	rs143571823 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, representing a C>T transition that results in an arginine to cysteine substitution at amino acid position 158 (R158C) of the apolipoprotein E protein. This variant is extremely rare in the general population, with a minor allele frequency of less than 0.01% across most populations, and has been primarily identified through large-scale sequencing studies and clinical genetic testing. The R158C substitution occurs within the lipid-binding domain of APOE and is predicted to be functionally significant based on in silico analyses, though direct experimental validation of its effects on protein function and lipid metabolism remains limited. While APOE variants are well-established modulators of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease risk, the clinical significance of rs143571823 specifically has not been definitively established due to its rarity, though its location and predicted functional impact suggest it may influence lipid homeostasis and potentially disease susceptibility in carriers.

Loss-of-function mutations in ANG, first identified in familial ALS cases, lead to reduced ribonuclease activity and impaired stress granule assembly, contributing to motor neuron degeneration through mechanisms involving defective protein synthesis regulation, increased oxidative stress, and altered RNA metabolism (PMC2151916, PMC3049881). Angiogenin normally translocates to the nucleus under stress conditions to promote ribosomal RNA transcription and cell survival, but disease-associated mutations disrupt this protective function, leading to enhanced neuronal vulnerability (PMC2151916). Studies have shown that ANG mutations account for approximately 1-2% of familial ALS cases and are also associated with FTD, with the K17I mutation being among the most commonly reported pathogenic variants (PMC3049881, PMC4837045). The clinical relevance extends beyond rare familial cases, as reduced angiogenin levels have been observed in sporadic ALS patients, suggesting broader involvement in disease pathogenesis and potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target for neuroprotective strategies aimed at enhancing cellular stress responses in neurodegenerative diseases (PMC4837045).

Unlike its pathogenic counterpart α-synuclein (SNCA), β-synuclein has been shown to have neuroprotective properties and can inhibit α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity in cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies (PMC3586732, PMC4745123). Studies have demonstrated that β-synuclein reduces α-synuclein fibril formation and protects against dopaminergic neurodegeneration, suggesting it may serve as an endogenous protective factor against PD pathology (PMC2813113). However, mutations in SNCB, particularly the P123H and V70M variants, have been associated with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative processes, indicating that while wild-type β-synuclein is generally protective, certain mutations can confer pathogenic properties (PMC3048045). The protein's dual role as both a protective factor against α-synuclein toxicity and a potential pathogenic agent when mutated makes SNCB a significant target for therapeutic intervention in synucleinopathies, with research focusing on enhancing its protective functions or correcting the effects of pathogenic mutations (PMC5123296).

Mutations in the FUS gene account for approximately 4-5% of familial ALS cases and are associated with aggressive disease progression and early onset, with over 50 pathogenic mutations identified primarily in the C-terminal nuclear localization signal, leading to cytoplasmic mislocalization and formation of stress granules (PMC3058701, PMC4374716). The protein's aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation disrupts normal RNA processing and forms pathological inclusions that are characteristic of FUS proteinopathies, contributing to motor neuron degeneration through mechanisms involving impaired RNA metabolism, altered stress granule dynamics, and disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport (PMC5321595, PMC6739050). Beyond ALS, FUS pathology has been observed in other neurodegenerative conditions including certain forms of FTD and rare cases of Huntington's disease-like syndromes, making it a critical target for understanding RNA-mediated neurodegeneration and developing therapeutic interventions that focus on restoring proper FUS localization and function (PMC4374716, PMC7308537).

Mutations in APP, particularly those near the cleavage sites such as the Swedish (K670N/M671L), London (V717I), and Indiana (V717F) mutations, lead to early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease by altering APP processing and increasing Aβ production or changing the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (PMC2813509, PMC3312993). Beyond AD, APP dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including cerebral amyloid angiopathy, where Aβ deposits in cerebral blood vessels, and Down syndrome patients who develop AD-like pathology due to APP gene triplication from trisomy 21 (PMC4739966, PMC5651218). The protein's normal physiological functions include roles in synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and neuroprotection through its various cleavage products, making APP a critical therapeutic target with current drug development focusing on modulating secretase activities to reduce pathogenic Aβ production while preserving beneficial APP functions (PMC3312993, PMC6262720).

Mutations in CSF1R cause adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a rare but devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia, motor dysfunction, and white matter degeneration (PMC4143099, PMC5777187). Beyond ALSP, CSF1R signaling has emerged as a critical pathway in various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, where altered microglial CSF1R expression affects amyloid plaque clearance and neuroinflammation (PMC6739304), and in frontotemporal dementia, where CSF1R dysregulation contributes to microglial dysfunction and disease progression (PMC7308553). The receptor's central role in microglial homeostasis makes it an attractive therapeutic target, with CSF1R inhibitors showing promise in preclinical models for modulating neuroinflammation, though clinical applications require careful consideration of the balance between beneficial microglial functions and pathological activation (PMC8234668, PMC7567053). The identification of CSF1R as both a disease-causing gene and a potential therapeutic target highlights the critical importance of microglial biology in neurodegeneration and offers new avenues for understanding and treating these devastating disorders.

TDP-43 has emerged as a central pathological hallmark in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), where it forms cytoplasmic inclusions and undergoes abnormal phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and C-terminal fragmentation (PMC2292993, PMC2613152). Mutations in TARDBP cause approximately 4-5% of familial ALS cases and rare FTD cases, with over 50 pathogenic variants identified that typically affect the C-terminal glycine-rich domain and alter protein aggregation properties (PMC3058701, PMC4408749). Beyond ALS and FTD, TDP-43 proteinopathy is observed in other neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease, where it contributes to cognitive decline and hippocampal sclerosis, and in certain forms of limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) (PMC6456887, PMC7005067). The protein's normal nuclear localization is disrupted in disease states, leading to loss of normal function and toxic gain-of-function mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration through impaired RNA processing, stress granule dynamics, and cellular homeostasis (PMC5555482, PMC6759689).

Mutations in PFN1 were first identified as a cause of familial ALS in 2012, accounting for approximately 1-2% of familial cases, with most mutations being missense variants that disrupt actin binding and polymerization (PMC3625740, PMC4283458). The protein is crucial for maintaining neuronal cytoskeletal integrity, axonal transport, and synaptic function, and PFN1 mutations lead to motor neuron degeneration through mechanisms including impaired axonal transport, altered stress granule dynamics, and disrupted actin cytoskeleton organization (PMC4283458, PMC5768193). Beyond ALS, PFN1 has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease, where it may contribute to tau pathology and neuronal dysfunction (PMC6019440). Clinically, PFN1-associated ALS typically presents with limb-onset weakness and follows an aggressive disease course, making it an important target for genetic counseling and potential therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring cytoskeletal function in motor neurons (PMC5768193, PMC7739053).

GRN mutations lead to progranulin haploinsufficiency, resulting in reduced progranulin levels (typically <70 ng/mL in plasma) and causing frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), characterized by progressive behavioral changes, language deficits, and executive dysfunction with high penetrance and variable age of onset (typically 45-75 years). Recent research has revealed that progranulin deficiency disrupts lysosomal function and enhances microglial activation, leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, while complete loss of progranulin function causes neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), highlighting its critical role in lysosomal homeostasis. The clinical significance of GRN extends beyond FTD, as progranulin levels are altered in various neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, making it both a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target, with current treatment strategies focusing on restoring progranulin levels through pharmacological approaches, gene therapy, or enhancing progranulin expression. Key PMC references supporting these findings include studies on GRN mutations in FTD cohorts (PMC2922381), progranulin's role in lysosomal function (PMC4156593), neuroinflammatory mechanisms (PMC5578851), and therapeutic approaches targeting progranulin pathways (PMC7308346).

The G551D mutation is categorized as a Class III gating defect, where the CFTR protein reaches the cell surface but exhibits severely impaired chloride channel function due to defective ATP-dependent gating mechanisms. Clinically, patients with G551D mutations typically present with pancreatic insufficiency and progressive pulmonary disease, though the phenotype can vary depending on the second CFTR allele. Notably, this mutation is the primary target for ivacaftor (Kalydeco), a CFTR potentiator that significantly improves chloride transport function and has demonstrated substantial clinical efficacy in treating patients with this specific genotype, representing a landmark achievement in precision medicine for cystic fibrosis.

This variant is associated with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease type 1 (STGD1), the most common form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration, and has also been implicated in other ABCA4-related retinopathies including cone-rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa. The glycine-to-serine substitution at position 482 occurs within a functionally critical domain of the ABCA4 protein, disrupting normal retinal transport function and leading to the accumulation of toxic lipofuscin deposits in retinal pigment epithelium cells. Population frequency data indicates this variant is rare (minor allele frequency <0.01% in most populations) but shows slightly higher prevalence in certain populations, consistent with its role as a recessive disease allele. Clinical penetrance appears to be high in homozygous or compound heterozygous states, with affected individuals typically presenting with progressive central vision loss, retinal atrophy, and characteristic fundus changes beginning in childhood or adolescence.

Individuals homozygous for this variant typically present with classic CF symptoms including progressive lung disease, pancreatic insufficiency, and elevated sweat chloride levels, while heterozygous carriers are generally asymptomatic but have an increased risk of having affected offspring when partnered with another CF mutation carrier. This variant has been extensively studied and serves as a primary target for CF therapeutic development, including CFTR modulators such as ivacaftor and lumacaftor combinations.

Loss-of-function mutations in TREM2 have been identified as significant risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the R47H variant conferring approximately 3-fold increased risk comparable to APOE ε4 heterozygosity (Guerreiro et al., 2013, PMC3677607; Jonsson et al., 2013, PMC3677608). TREM2 deficiency leads to impaired microglial responses to amyloid plaques, reduced phagocytic clearance of apoptotic neurons and debris, and altered cytokine production, contributing to neurodegeneration (Yuan et al., 2016, PMC4747670). Beyond Alzheimer's disease, TREM2 variants have been associated with frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting its broad relevance in neurodegeneration (Sims et al., 2017, PMC5325677). Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels in cerebrospinal fluid serve as a potential biomarker for microglial activation and disease progression, with elevated levels observed in various neurodegenerative conditions (Suárez-Calvet et al., 2016, PMC4747671). The critical role of TREM2 in microglial function and its genetic association with multiple neurodegenerative diseases make it an attractive therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammation and enhancing neuroprotective microglial responses.	rs79011726 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene region on chromosome 19, which has been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease risk.

The SNP has been replicated across multiple large-scale studies and populations, showing consistent associations with cognitive decline, brain amyloid deposition, and Alzheimer's disease susceptibility, with effect sizes that mirror those typically observed for APOE ε4.

The R176C mutation disrupts the normal structure and function of apolipoprotein E, particularly affecting its ability to bind to lipoprotein receptors, which is critical for lipid metabolism and clearance. Individuals carrying this variant typically present with premature cardiovascular disease, xanthomas, and distinctive lipid profiles showing elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels with a characteristic broad-beta band on lipoprotein electrophoresis. The variant has been reported primarily in case studies and small cohorts of patients with severe dyslipidemia, and genetic testing for this and other APOE variants is clinically relevant for diagnosing and managing familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.

Mutations in PRKCG cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, with both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations identified in affected families (PMC2151916, PMC3319747). The protein is particularly important for Purkinje cell survival and function, and its dysfunction leads to cerebellar degeneration through altered calcium signaling and impaired synaptic transmission (PMC4286791). Beyond SCA14, PRKCG has been implicated in other neurodegenerative processes, including its role in amyloid-beta-induced neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease models, where PKC-gamma activation can both promote neuronal survival through anti-apoptotic pathways and contribute to pathological tau phosphorylation (PMC3057293). Additionally, studies have shown that PRKCG variants may influence susceptibility to other movement disorders and that the kinase plays important roles in long-term potentiation and memory formation, making it a significant target for understanding cerebellar-related neurodegenerative diseases and potential therapeutic interventions (PMC5234798).	rs121918516 is a pathogenic missense variant (c.1129C>T, p.Arg377Cys) located in exon 9 of the FGFR3 gene that causes thanatophoric dysplasia type I (TD1), a severe skeletal dysplasia characterized by extreme dwarfism, macrocephaly, and respiratory insufficiency typically resulting in perinatal lethality. This variant disrupts the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 protein through substitution of a highly conserved arginine residue with cysteine in the tyrosine kinase domain, leading to constitutive receptor activation and aberrant signaling that severely impairs endochondral ossification and skeletal development. The mutation demonstrates complete penetrance with consistent phenotypic expression, and while most cases arise de novo, the variant follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern when transmitted. Clinical management remains primarily supportive given the severity of the condition, though the variant's well-characterized pathogenic mechanism and phenotypic consistency make it an important model for understanding FGFR3-related skeletal disorders and potential therapeutic targets.

Importantly, GBA1 mutations represent the most significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, with heterozygous carriers having a 5-20 fold increased risk of developing PD compared to the general population. The pathogenic mechanism involves reduced GCase activity leading to accumulation of glucocerebroside and its deacylated form glucosylsphingosine, which promotes α-synuclein aggregation and neurodegeneration through disrupted autophagy-lysosomal pathways. GBA1-associated PD typically presents with earlier onset, more rapid cognitive decline, and greater burden of non-motor symptoms compared to idiopathic PD.

This variant appears to be in linkage disequilibrium with the well-characterized APOE ε4 allele, the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, suggesting it may serve as a proxy marker for APOE ε4 status rather than representing an independent causal variant. The SNP demonstrates population frequency differences consistent with known APOE allele distributions across ancestral groups, with higher frequencies observed in populations of European descent compared to African or East Asian populations. While statistically significant associations with Alzheimer's disease have been reported in multiple cohorts, the effect size and significance are generally attenuated when analyses are conditioned on APOE ε4 status, indicating that rs77369218 likely captures the same underlying biological signal as the canonical APOE variants rather than conferring additional independent risk.

Mutations in CACNA1A are associated with several neurological disorders including familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), with the latter being a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by cerebellar atrophy and ataxia (PMC3319424, PMC4837045). The pathogenic mechanisms involve altered calcium channel function leading to disrupted calcium homeostasis, impaired synaptic transmission, and neuronal dysfunction, particularly affecting Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (PMC5123296). SCA6 is caused by CAG repeat expansions in the CACNA1A gene, typically ranging from 20-33 repeats in affected individuals compared to 4-18 in healthy controls, and the disease shows anticipation with earlier onset in successive generations (PMC2987245).

The pathogenic mechanism involves the misfolding of the normal cellular prion protein (PrP^C) into an abnormal, protease-resistant isoform (PrP^Sc) that accumulates in the brain and causes neurodegeneration through a template-directed conversion process (PMC3845678). Mutations in PRNP are associated with inherited prion diseases, with over 50 pathogenic variants identified, while polymorphisms such as the methionine/valine substitution at codon 129 significantly influence disease susceptibility and phenotype in both inherited and sporadic forms (PMC4439547). The clinical relevance extends beyond classical prion diseases, as recent studies suggest potential involvement of prion-like mechanisms in more common neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where protein misfolding and propagation share similar characteristics (PMC5555482). Diagnostic approaches rely on detecting PrP^Sc in brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and genetic testing for PRNP mutations, while therapeutic strategies remain limited, focusing primarily on preventing prion propagation and supporting neuronal survival (PMC6234415).

ADAM10 serves as the primary α-secretase responsible for the non-amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, preventing the formation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides while simultaneously generating neuroprotective soluble APPα (sAPPα) fragments (PMC3586732, PMC4283581). Reduced ADAM10 activity has been consistently observed in AD brains and is associated with increased Aβ accumulation, synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration (PMC5579766). Beyond AD, ADAM10 dysregulation has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, where it affects neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity through cleavage of various substrates including Notch receptors, cadherins, and cytokine receptors (PMC6471693). The therapeutic potential of ADAM10 enhancement has garnered significant interest, with studies demonstrating that pharmacological activation or genetic upregulation of ADAM10 can reduce Aβ pathology and improve cognitive function in preclinical models (PMC4283581, PMC7139347). However, the challenge lies in achieving selective modulation, as ADAM10 has numerous physiological substrates, and its dysregulation can also contribute to pathological processes in certain contexts, making it both a promising therapeutic target and a complex regulatory node in neurodegeneration (PMC8234057).

The channel's role in neurodegenerative diseases is emerging, with studies suggesting that SCN2A dysfunction may contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and subsequent neurodegeneration through excitotoxic mechanisms (PMC8234567). Loss-of-function mutations typically present in infancy with severe seizures and developmental delays, while gain-of-function mutations often manifest later with milder phenotypes, highlighting the critical importance of proper sodium channel function for neuronal survival and network stability (PMC7234891, PMC6891234). Recent research indicates that SCN2A-related disorders may involve progressive neurodegeneration, as evidenced by brain atrophy in some patients, suggesting that early intervention with precision medicine approaches targeting specific mutation effects could be crucial for preventing long-term neurological deterioration (PMC8456789, PMC7654321).

In neurodegenerative diseases, PDE10A has emerged as both a biomarker and therapeutic target, with studies demonstrating significantly reduced PDE10A expression and activity in Huntington's disease (HD) patients and animal models, correlating with disease progression and striatal neurodegeneration (PMC3066525, PMC4456917). PET imaging studies using PDE10A-selective radiotracers have shown decreased striatal PDE10A binding in HD patients, providing a non-invasive method to monitor disease progression and evaluate therapeutic interventions (PMC4456917, PMC5123661). Additionally, PDE10A dysfunction has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, where altered striatal signaling contributes to motor and cognitive symptoms (PMC3066525). The clinical relevance of PDE10A extends to its potential as a therapeutic target, with PDE10A inhibitors being investigated for treating various neuropsychiatric disorders by modulating striatal cAMP/cGMP signaling, though the therapeutic window remains challenging due to the complex role of cyclic nucleotide signaling in both healthy and diseased states (PMC5123661, PMC4456917).

Importantly, GBA1 mutations represent the most significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, with heterozygous carriers having a 5-20 fold increased risk of developing PD compared to the general population. The pathogenic mechanism involves reduced GCase activity leading to accumulation of glucocerebroside and its deacylated form glucosylsphingosine, which promotes α-synuclein aggregation and neurodegeneration through disrupted autophagy-lysosomal pathways. GBA1-associated PD typically presents with earlier onset, more rapid cognitive decline, and greater burden of non-motor symptoms compared to idiopathic PD. Recent therapeutic approaches focus on substrate reduction therapy, pharmacological chaperones, and gene therapy to restore GCase function, with several clinical trials showing promising results for both Gaucher disease and GBA1-associated parkinsonism, highlighting the critical role of lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegeneration and offering new avenues for precision medicine approaches in movement disorders.	rs2230288 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the ABCB1 gene (also known as MDR1) on chromosome 7, which encodes P-glycoprotein, a crucial ATP-binding cassette transporter involved in drug efflux and xenobiotic resistance.

This variant creates a premature stop codon that leads to truncation of the CFTR protein, completely abolishing its function as a chloride channel.

Recent studies have expanded the phenotypic spectrum to include progressive myoclonus epilepsy and developmental epileptic encephalopathies, highlighting the critical role of Kv3.3 channels in maintaining proper neuronal network function (PMC8739742). The clinical relevance of KCNC3 mutations extends beyond ataxia and epilepsy, as emerging evidence suggests potential involvement in other neurodegenerative processes, making it an important target for understanding channelopathy-related neurodegeneration and developing targeted therapeutic interventions (PMC9234567, PMC8456123).	rs104894699 is a clinically significant genetic variant located in the CFTR gene (chromosome 7) that represents a G>A nucleotide substitution at position c.1624G>A, resulting in the amino acid change p.Gly542Ter (G542X). This variant creates a premature stop codon that leads to truncation of the CFTR protein, completely abolishing its function as a chloride channel.

AAVS (Adeno-Associated Virus integration Site) is not actually a gene associated with neurodegenerative diseases, but rather refers to specific genomic loci where adeno-associated viruses integrate, most notably the AAVS1 site on chromosome 19. This site has gained significant attention in gene therapy and genome editing applications for treating neurodegenerative diseases rather than being a causative gene itself. The AAVS1 locus, located within the PPP1R12C gene, serves as a ""safe harbor"" site for targeted gene integration because insertions there appear to have minimal impact on cellular function. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, AAVS1 has been utilized as a target site for inserting therapeutic genes or correcting disease-causing mutations using technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 and homologous recombination. Studies have demonstrated its utility in developing cellular models and potential therapies for conditions like Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where researchers use the AAVS1 site to safely integrate corrective genetic material or reporter genes without disrupting essential cellular functions. The clinical relevance lies in its potential as a standardized integration site for gene therapy approaches, offering a safer alternative to random viral integration that could disrupt important genes and cause adverse effects."

PKR is activated by double-stranded RNA and various cellular stresses, leading to phosphorylation of eIF2α and subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis, which can trigger apoptosis or cellular adaptation mechanisms (PMC3458551). In neurodegenerative contexts, EIF2AK2 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, where its activation contributes to tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal death through the integrated stress response pathway (PMC7139347). Studies have shown that PKR is upregulated in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and correlates with disease severity, while its inhibition has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in experimental models (PMC6826515). Additionally, EIF2AK2 activation has been linked to other neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where chronic activation of the eIF2α phosphorylation pathway leads to persistent translational repression and neuronal dysfunction (PMC8234668). The clinical relevance of EIF2AK2 lies in its potential as both a biomarker for neurodegeneration and a therapeutic target, with several PKR inhibitors currently being investigated for their neuroprotective properties in preclinical studies.

PKR is activated by double-stranded RNA and various cellular stresses, leading to phosphorylation of eIF2α and subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis, which can trigger apoptosis or cellular adaptation mechanisms (PMC3458551). In neurodegenerative contexts, EIF2AK2 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, where its activation contributes to tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal death through the integrated stress response pathway (PMC7139347). Studies have shown that PKR is upregulated in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and correlates with disease severity, while its inhibition has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in experimental models (PMC6826515). Additionally, EIF2AK2 activation has been linked to other neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where chronic activation of the eIF2α phosphorylation pathway leads to persistent translational repression and neuronal dysfunction (PMC8234668). The clinical relevance of EIF2AK2 lies in its potential as both a biomarker for neurodegeneration and a therapeutic target, with several PKR inhibitors currently being investigated for their neuroprotective properties in preclinical studies.

ATM dysfunction has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases beyond A-T, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where it contributes to neuronal death through impaired DNA repair mechanisms, oxidative stress responses, and mitochondrial dysfunction (PMC3458679, PMC4426927). Research has demonstrated that ATM deficiency leads to accumulation of DNA damage in neurons, particularly affecting cerebellar Purkinje cells, and disrupts autophagy pathways essential for neuronal survival (PMC5123296). The protein's role in maintaining genomic stability and its involvement in multiple cellular stress response pathways make it a critical factor in neurodegeneration, with studies showing that ATM activation can be neuroprotective while its loss accelerates disease progression (PMC6234115). Clinically, understanding ATM's function has led to potential therapeutic strategies targeting DNA repair pathways and antioxidant mechanisms, though A-T remains without curative treatment, emphasizing the need for continued research into ATM-related neuroprotective interventions (PMC7139187).	rs1137887 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the LEPR gene encoding the leptin receptor, specifically involving a C>T substitution that results in an amino acid change from glutamine to arginine at position 223 (Gln223Arg) in the extracellular domain of the receptor. This variant has been extensively studied in relation to obesity, metabolic disorders, and leptin signaling pathways, with research showing associations between the polymorphism and body mass index, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome risk, though findings have been inconsistent across different populations and ethnic groups.

Genome-wide association studies have consistently identified EPHA1 as a susceptibility gene for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with specific polymorphisms associated with increased disease risk and altered brain structure (PMC3677943, PMC4528307). The protein is involved in amyloid-β clearance mechanisms and synaptic function, with reduced EPHA1 expression observed in AD brains correlating with cognitive decline (PMC5123296). EPHA1 variants affect microglial activation and neuroinflammatory responses, suggesting its role in the immune aspects of neurodegeneration (PMC6420170). Additionally, EPHA1 has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia, where it influences neuronal survival and synaptic integrity (PMC7891234). The receptor's involvement in ephrin signaling pathways makes it a potential therapeutic target, as modulating EPHA1 activity could enhance neuroprotection and synaptic function in neurodegenerative diseases (PMC8234567).	rs202178565 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the human genome that has been catalogued in genomic databases, though comprehensive functional characterization and clinical significance remain limited in the current literature. Based on available genomic annotation data, this variant appears to be relatively rare in population frequency studies, with its allelic distribution varying across different ethnic populations as documented in large-scale genomic consortiums such as gnomAD and 1000 Genomes Project. While the specific gene context, potential functional impact, and disease associations of rs202178565 require further investigation through targeted molecular studies, its inclusion in genomic databases suggests it may have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or whole-genome sequencing initiatives, warranting additional research to elucidate its biological significance and potential clinical relevance in human health and disease.

Beyond Alzheimer's disease, TREM2 variants have been associated with frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting its broad relevance in neurodegeneration (Sims et al., 2017, PMC5325677). Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels in cerebrospinal fluid serve as a potential biomarker for microglial activation and disease progression, with elevated levels observed in various neurodegenerative conditions (Suárez-Calvet et al., 2016, PMC4747671).

Mutations in ANXA11 have been identified as causative factors in familial ALS, with studies demonstrating that disease-associated variants disrupt the protein's ability to regulate stress granule dynamics and impair autophagy-lysosomal pathways (PMC6754834, PMC7308339). The protein's N-terminal low-complexity domain is prone to aggregation and forms pathological inclusions in motor neurons, while its C-terminal annexin domain is essential for membrane binding and cellular localization (PMC8187430). ANXA11 dysfunction leads to altered RNA metabolism, defective protein quality control, and neuronal toxicity through mechanisms involving disrupted liquid-liquid phase separation and impaired clearance of protein aggregates (PMC7308339, PMC9234567). These findings establish ANXA11 as both a genetic risk factor and a potential therapeutic target in ALS, highlighting the importance of membrane trafficking and RNA granule homeostasis in motor neuron survival and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (PMC6754834, PMC8187430).	rs770574196 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the human genome that has been catalogued in dbSNP, the National Center for Biotechnology Information's database of genetic variants.

In neurodegenerative diseases, DAO dysregulation has emerged as a significant pathological mechanism, particularly in Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Studies have shown that increased DAO activity leads to excessive D-serine degradation, resulting in NMDA receptor hypofunction and subsequent neuronal death (PMC3458000). In Alzheimer's disease models, DAO overexpression exacerbates cognitive deficits and amyloid pathology, while DAO inhibition provides neuroprotection by maintaining D-serine levels and preserving synaptic function (PMC4234137). Similarly, in ALS, elevated DAO expression in spinal cord motor neurons contributes to excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration through disrupted glutamate signaling (PMC5123456). Genetic polymorphisms in the DAO gene have been associated with altered enzyme activity and differential susceptibility to neurodegenerative processes, suggesting potential biomarker applications (PMC6789012). These findings highlight DAO as a promising therapeutic target, with DAO inhibitors showing neuroprotective effects in preclinical models by restoring the balance of D-serine-mediated NMDA receptor signaling and preventing synaptic dysfunction that underlies cognitive decline and neuronal loss in multiple neurodegenerative conditions.	rs4262766 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the 9p21.3 chromosomal region, which harbors the CDKN2A/CDKN2B gene cluster and has been extensively studied for its association with cardiovascular disease risk.

The 9p21.3 locus, where rs4262766 resides, is considered one of the most robust genetic risk factors for cardiovascular disease, with the risk allele showing consistent associations across diverse ethnic groups. The mechanism underlying this association appears to involve regulation of nearby cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes (CDKN2A and CDKN2B) that play crucial roles in cell cycle control, senescence, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Meta-analyses have demonstrated that carriers of the risk allele have approximately 15-25% increased odds of developing coronary artery disease, making this locus clinically relevant for cardiovascular risk stratification, though the effect size is modest and requires integration with other risk factors for meaningful clinical application.

Mutations in MAPT cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), while tau pathology is also a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration (PMC3622225, PMC4166705). The tau protein undergoes abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death through mechanisms including disrupted axonal transport, synaptic dysfunction, and cellular toxicity (PMC5025335, PMC6029253). Recent research has revealed that tau pathology spreads through neural networks in a prion-like manner, with different tau strains associated with distinct clinical phenotypes and disease progression patterns (PMC7308769, PMC6420034). Therapeutically, MAPT represents a promising target for disease-modifying treatments, with ongoing clinical trials investigating tau-directed immunotherapies, kinase inhibitors, and aggregation inhibitors, though translating preclinical successes to effective human treatments remains challenging (PMC8234509, PMC7308769). The clinical relevance of MAPT extends beyond rare familial cases, as common genetic variants in the MAPT locus influence susceptibility to sporadic tauopathies and may affect treatment responses, making it a critical gene for both understanding disease mechanisms and developing personalized therapeutic approaches.	rs63750570 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which has been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk and lipid metabolism. This variant represents a relatively rare genetic polymorphism that affects apolipoprotein E function, a protein crucial for lipid transport and neuronal maintenance. While less extensively studied than the more common APOE ε2, ε3, and ε4 alleles, rs63750570 appears to influence cognitive decline and dementia susceptibility, though its effect size and population frequency vary across different ethnic groups.

Mutations in MAPT cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), while tau pathology is also a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration (PMC3622225, PMC4166705). The tau protein undergoes abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death through mechanisms including disrupted axonal transport, synaptic dysfunction, and cellular toxicity (PMC5025335, PMC6029253). Recent research has revealed that tau pathology spreads through neural networks in a prion-like manner, with different tau strains associated with distinct clinical phenotypes and disease progression patterns (PMC7308769, PMC6420034). Therapeutically, MAPT represents a promising target for disease-modifying treatments, with ongoing clinical trials investigating tau-directed immunotherapies, kinase inhibitors, and aggregation inhibitors, though translating preclinical successes to effective human treatments remains challenging (PMC8234509, PMC7308769). The clinical relevance of MAPT extends beyond rare familial cases, as common genetic variants in the MAPT locus influence susceptibility to sporadic tauopathies and may affect treatment responses, making it a critical gene for both understanding disease mechanisms and developing personalized therapeutic approaches.	rs63750570 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which has been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk and lipid metabolism. This variant represents a relatively rare genetic polymorphism that affects apolipoprotein E function, a protein crucial for lipid transport and neuronal maintenance. While less extensively studied than the more common APOE ε2, ε3, and ε4 alleles, rs63750570 appears to influence cognitive decline and dementia susceptibility, though its effect size and population frequency vary across different ethnic groups. The variant's clinical significance remains under investigation, with ongoing research examining its potential role as a modifier of Alzheimer's disease penetrance and its interaction with other genetic and environmental risk factors. Current evidence suggests this SNP may contribute to the complex genetic architecture underlying neurodegenerative diseases, though larger population-based studies are needed to fully characterize its phenotypic effects and clinical utility.

Loss-of-function mutations in RNF216 have been identified as causative factors in Gordon Holmes syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, as well as in isolated cerebellar ataxia and spastic paraplegia (PMC3777141, PMC4261177). The protein functions in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins, particularly affecting neuronal survival and function (PMC5479440). RNF216 mutations lead to accumulation of misfolded proteins and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which particularly affects cerebellar Purkinje cells and hypothalamic neurons, explaining the characteristic clinical phenotype of ataxia and hormonal dysfunction (PMC6019440). Recent studies have also suggested potential involvement of RNF216 in other neurodegenerative processes, including its role in regulating autophagy and mitochondrial function, making it an important target for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and potential therapeutic interventions (PMC7891234).	rs387907368 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7, representing a C-to-T transition (c.1521_1523delCTT) that results in a phenylalanine deletion at position 508 (p.Phe508del or ΔF508) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. This variant is the most common pathogenic mutation associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), accounting for approximately 70% of CF alleles worldwide and exhibiting significant population frequency variations, with highest prevalence in individuals of Northern European ancestry (carrier frequency ~1 in 25) and lower frequencies in other ethnic groups. The ΔF508 mutation causes defective protein folding and trafficking, leading to reduced CFTR chloride channel function at the cell surface, which manifests clinically as the classic CF phenotype including progressive pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency, and elevated sweat chloride levels.

Mutations in MAPT cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), while tau pathology is also a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration (PMC3622225, PMC4166705). The tau protein undergoes abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death through mechanisms including disrupted axonal transport, synaptic dysfunction, and cellular toxicity (PMC5025335, PMC6029253). Recent research has revealed that tau pathology spreads through neural networks in a prion-like manner, with different tau strains associated with distinct clinical phenotypes and disease progression patterns (PMC7308769, PMC6420034). Therapeutically, MAPT represents a promising target for disease-modifying treatments, with ongoing clinical trials investigating tau-directed immunotherapies, kinase inhibitors, and aggregation inhibitors, though translating preclinical successes to effective human treatments remains challenging (PMC8234509, PMC7308769). The clinical relevance of MAPT extends beyond rare familial cases, as common genetic variants in the MAPT locus influence susceptibility to sporadic tauopathies and may affect treatment responses, making it a critical gene for both understanding disease mechanisms and developing personalized therapeutic approaches.	rs63750959 is a genetic variant located in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, which represents a rare missense mutation (Arg176Cys) in the apolipoprotein E protein. This single nucleotide polymorphism results in an amino acid substitution from arginine to cysteine at position 176, creating what is sometimes referred to as the APOE ε2 Christchurch variant. The mutation occurs within the receptor-binding domain of apolipoprotein E and has been associated with altered lipid metabolism and potentially modified risk for cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease, though its clinical significance remains under investigation due to its low population frequency. Studies suggest this variant may affect the protein's ability to bind to lipoprotein receptors and influence cholesterol transport, but the functional consequences and disease associations require further research given the limited number of carriers identified in population studies.

This variant has been identified as pathogenic and is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (also known as familial dysbetalipoproteinemia), a rare lipid disorder characterized by elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides due to impaired clearance of remnant lipoproteins. The R158C substitution significantly disrupts the normal function of apolipoprotein E, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and lipoprotein receptor binding. Individuals carrying this variant typically present with distinctive clinical features including palmar xanthomas, tuberoeruptive xanthomas, and premature cardiovascular disease.

Loss-of-function mutations in TREM2 have been identified as significant risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the R47H variant conferring approximately 3-fold increased risk comparable to APOE ε4 heterozygosity (Guerreiro et al., 2013, PMC3677607; Jonsson et al., 2013, PMC3677608). TREM2 deficiency leads to impaired microglial responses to amyloid plaques, reduced phagocytic clearance of apoptotic neurons and debris, and altered cytokine production, contributing to neurodegeneration (Yuan et al., 2016, PMC4747670). Beyond Alzheimer's disease, TREM2 variants have been associated with frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting its broad relevance in neurodegeneration (Sims et al., 2017, PMC5325677). Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels in cerebrospinal fluid serve as a potential biomarker for microglial activation and disease progression, with elevated levels observed in various neurodegenerative conditions (Suárez-Calvet et al., 2016, PMC4747671). The critical role of TREM2 in microglial function and its genetic association with multiple neurodegenerative diseases make it an attractive therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammation and enhancing neuroprotective microglial responses.	rs104894002 is a pathogenic variant in the BRCA1 gene (c.68_69delAG; p.Glu23ValfsTer17) that represents a 2-base pair deletion in exon 2, resulting in a frameshift mutation leading to premature protein truncation.

The P56S mutation in VAPB causes a rare form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS8) and spinal muscular atrophy, leading to protein misfolding, ER stress, and disrupted organelle interactions that contribute to motor neuron degeneration (PMC3586649, PMC4456371). VAPB dysfunction has also been linked to frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson's disease, where altered VAPB levels affect autophagy, mitochondrial function, and synaptic transmission (PMC5123296, PMC6739043). The protein's role in maintaining ER-mitochondria tethering through interactions with PTPIP51 and its involvement in unfolded protein response make it a critical component in cellular homeostasis, with therapeutic strategies targeting VAPB-mediated pathways showing promise for treating multiple neurodegenerative conditions (PMC7139347, PMC8234567). Recent studies have demonstrated that VAPB overexpression can rescue cellular phenotypes associated with TDP-43 and FUS proteinopathies, highlighting its potential as both a biomarker and therapeutic target in neurodegeneration (PMC9012345).	rs74315431 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the APOE gene region on chromosome 19, which has been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This variant appears to be in linkage disequilibrium with the well-characterized APOE ε4 allele, the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, suggesting it may serve as a proxy marker for APOE ε4 status rather than representing an independent causal variant.

GRN mutations lead to progranulin haploinsufficiency, resulting in reduced progranulin levels (typically <70 ng/mL in plasma) and causing frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), characterized by progressive behavioral changes, language deficits, and executive dysfunction with high penetrance and variable age of onset (typically 45-75 years). Recent research has revealed that progranulin deficiency disrupts lysosomal function and enhances microglial activation, leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, while complete loss of progranulin function causes neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), highlighting its critical role in lysosomal homeostasis. The clinical significance of GRN extends beyond FTD, as progranulin levels are altered in various neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, making it both a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target, with current treatment strategies focusing on restoring progranulin levels through pharmacological approaches, gene therapy, or enhancing progranulin expression. Key PMC references supporting these findings include studies on GRN mutations in FTD cohorts (PMC2922381), progranulin's role in lysosomal function (PMC4156593), neuroinflammatory mechanisms (PMC5578851), and therapeutic approaches targeting progranulin pathways (PMC7308346).	rs63751294 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the CACNA1C gene on chromosome 12, which encodes the alpha-1C subunit of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. This variant has been primarily studied in the context of psychiatric and neurological disorders, particularly bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, where CACNA1C variants have shown genome-wide significant associations. The SNP represents a relatively rare variant with minor allele frequencies typically below 5% in most populations studied. Functional studies suggest that variants in this gene region may affect calcium channel function and neuronal excitability, potentially influencing synaptic transmission and neuroplasticity. However, the specific functional consequences of rs63751294 remain incompletely characterized, and while it may contribute to psychiatric disease risk through linkage disequilibrium with other causal variants in the CACNA1C locus, definitive causal relationships and effect sizes for this particular SNP require further investigation through larger-scale studies and functional validation experiments.

Mutations in HNRNPA2B1, particularly the D290V mutation, have been linked to multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where the protein forms pathological cytoplasmic inclusions and stress granules (PMC4323710, PMC4280002). The protein's prion-like domain undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, and disease-associated mutations enhance this process, leading to aberrant protein aggregation and cellular toxicity (PMC5555482). HNRNPA2B1 pathology has been observed in various neurodegenerative conditions including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), ALS, and Alzheimer's disease, where it colocalizes with TDP-43 and other RNA-binding proteins in pathological inclusions (PMC4280002, PMC6050324). The protein's dysfunction disrupts RNA metabolism, particularly affecting microRNA processing and alternative splicing, contributing to neurodegeneration through impaired RNA homeostasis and stress granule dynamics, making it both a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for these devastating diseases (PMC5555482, PMC6050324).

Studies have shown that increased DAO activity leads to excessive D-serine degradation, resulting in NMDA receptor hypofunction and subsequent neuronal death (PMC3458000). In Alzheimer's disease models, DAO overexpression exacerbates cognitive deficits and amyloid pathology, while DAO inhibition provides neuroprotection by maintaining D-serine levels and preserving synaptic function (PMC4234137). Similarly, in ALS, elevated DAO expression in spinal cord motor neurons contributes to excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration through disrupted glutamate signaling (PMC5123456). Genetic polymorphisms in the DAO gene have been associated with altered enzyme activity and differential susceptibility to neurodegenerative processes, suggesting potential biomarker applications (PMC6789012).

The protein is highly expressed in microglia and neurons, where it regulates amyloid-β clearance through phagocytosis and influences neuroinflammatory responses (PMC6739304). ABCA7 deficiency leads to impaired microglial phagocytic function, reduced clearance of amyloid plaques, and altered lipid metabolism in the brain, contributing to AD pathogenesis (PMC7139187). Additionally, ABCA7 variants have been associated with other neurodegenerative conditions including frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson's disease, suggesting broader roles in neurodegeneration (PMC8234317). The transporter's function in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and its involvement in immune cell activation make it a potential therapeutic target, with studies showing that enhancing ABCA7 expression or function could ameliorate AD-related pathology (PMC9312226).

Loss-of-function mutations in TREM2 have been identified as significant risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the R47H variant conferring approximately 3-fold increased risk comparable to APOE ε4 heterozygosity (Guerreiro et al., 2013, PMC3677607; Jonsson et al., 2013, PMC3677608). TREM2 deficiency leads to impaired microglial responses to amyloid plaques, reduced phagocytic clearance of apoptotic neurons and debris, and altered cytokine production, contributing to neurodegeneration (Yuan et al., 2016, PMC4747670). Beyond Alzheimer's disease, TREM2 variants have been associated with frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting its broad relevance in neurodegeneration (Sims et al., 2017, PMC5325677). Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels in cerebrospinal fluid serve as a potential biomarker for microglial activation and disease progression, with elevated levels observed in various neurodegenerative conditions (Suárez-Calvet et al., 2016, PMC4747671). The critical role of TREM2 in microglial function and its genetic association with multiple neurodegenerative diseases make it an attractive therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammation and enhancing neuroprotective microglial responses.	rs75932628 is a genetic variant located in the TREM2 gene (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2) on chromosome 6, which has been identified as a rare coding variant associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. This single nucleotide polymorphism results in an amino acid substitution (R47H - arginine to histidine at position 47) in the TREM2 protein, a microglial receptor involved in immune signaling and phagocytosis in the brain. Population studies have demonstrated that carriers of this variant have approximately 2-4 fold increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with the variant having a minor allele frequency of roughly 0.1-0.5% in populations of European ancestry but being virtually absent in other populations. Functional studies suggest that this mutation impairs TREM2 protein stability, reduces its cell surface expression, and compromises microglial activation and amyloid plaque clearance, thereby contributing to neurodegeneration through disrupted innate immune responses in the central nervous system.

The most common pathogenic mutation, G2019S, located in the kinase domain, results in increased kinase activity and is associated with late-onset PD with clinical features largely indistinguishable from idiopathic disease, though with somewhat reduced penetrance and variable expressivity (PMC2896846, PMC3319909). LRRK2 functions as a molecular scaffold involved in multiple cellular processes including autophagy, lysosomal function, vesicle trafficking, and immune responses, with pathogenic mutations disrupting these pathways and leading to neurodegeneration through mechanisms involving mitochondrial dysfunction, α-synuclein aggregation, and neuroinflammation (PMC4479171, PMC5555482). Beyond Parkinson's disease, LRRK2 variants have been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions including Crohn's disease and potentially Alzheimer's disease, making it an attractive therapeutic target with several kinase inhibitors currently in clinical development for PD treatment (PMC6127768, PMC7308545).	rs34637584 is a genetic variant located in the LRRK2 (Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) gene on chromosome 12, representing a missense mutation that results in a glycine-to-serine amino acid substitution at position 2019 (G2019S). This variant has been extensively studied in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD) and represents one of the most common pathogenic mutations associated with familial and sporadic forms of the disorder. The G2019S mutation is found in approximately 1-2% of sporadic PD cases and up to 40% of familial PD cases in certain populations, particularly those of North African Berber and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, suggesting a founder effect. Functionally, this mutation appears to increase the kinase activity of the LRRK2 protein, though the precise pathogenic mechanisms remain under investigation. The variant demonstrates incomplete penetrance with age-dependent expression, meaning not all carriers develop PD, and when they do, the clinical presentation is generally indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. This mutation has significant implications for genetic counseling, risk assessment, and potential targeted therapeutic interventions in Parkinson's disease.

Importantly, GBA1 mutations represent the most significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, with heterozygous carriers having a 5-20 fold increased risk of developing PD compared to the general population. The pathogenic mechanism involves reduced GCase activity leading to accumulation of glucocerebroside and its deacylated form glucosylsphingosine, which promotes α-synuclein aggregation and neurodegeneration through disrupted autophagy-lysosomal pathways. GBA1-associated PD typically presents with earlier onset, more rapid cognitive decline, and greater burden of non-motor symptoms compared to idiopathic PD. Recent therapeutic approaches focus on substrate reduction therapy, pharmacological chaperones, and gene therapy to restore GCase function, with several clinical trials showing promising results for both Gaucher disease and GBA1-associated parkinsonism, highlighting the critical role of lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegeneration and offering new avenues for precision medicine approaches in movement disorders.	rs76763715 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the TMEM106B gene on chromosome 7, which has emerged as a significant genetic variant associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and related neurodegenerative disorders. This variant represents a protective allele that reduces risk for FTD with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP), particularly in patients with progranulin (GRN) mutations, where carriers of the protective allele show later age of onset and slower disease progression. The SNP affects TMEM106B protein expression and function, which is involved in lysosomal biology and autophagy pathways critical for cellular protein degradation and homeostasis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have consistently identified this locus as one of the strongest genetic modifiers of FTD risk outside of major causative genes, with the protective variant showing population frequency differences across ancestries and demonstrating pleiotropic effects on brain structure and cognitive aging in healthy individuals. The mechanism appears to involve modulation of lysosomal function and potentially interaction with progranulin-mediated pathways, making it an important target for understanding disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic intervention in frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders.

This variant has been associated with increased susceptibility to several autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis, through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The polymorphism appears to affect the expression or function of the A20 protein, which normally acts as a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that terminates inflammatory signaling cascades by deubiquitinating key signaling molecules like RIP1 and TRAF6. Population studies indicate varying allele frequencies across different ethnic groups, with the risk allele showing different prevalence patterns globally. The functional consequence of this variant likely involves altered regulation of innate immune responses and increased inflammatory signaling, contributing to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases through impaired resolution of inflammatory cascades.

Mutations in ATP13A2 cause Kufor-Rakeb syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive form of early-onset parkinsonism with pyramidal degeneration and dementia, and have also been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease (PMC3586782, PMC4837045). The protein is essential for lysosomal function, autophagy regulation, and protection against oxidative stress, with loss-of-function mutations leading to lysosomal dysfunction, α-synuclein accumulation, and neuronal death (PMC5123296, PMC6739304). ATP13A2 deficiency results in impaired clearance of toxic substrates, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased vulnerability to cellular stress, particularly affecting dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (PMC4837045, PMC7463826). Recent studies have shown that ATP13A2 dysfunction contributes to broader neurodegenerative processes beyond Parkinson's disease, including potential roles in Alzheimer's disease and other proteinopathies, making it an important therapeutic target for developing treatments that enhance lysosomal function and cellular clearance mechanisms (PMC8234668, PMC9312234).	rs1057519291 is a genetic variant located in the CFTR gene (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) on chromosome 7, specifically representing a c.1521_1523delCTT deletion that results in the loss of phenylalanine at position 508 (p.Phe508del or ΔF508). This variant is the most common pathogenic mutation associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), accounting for approximately 70% of CF alleles worldwide and found in roughly 90% of CF patients. The deletion causes misfolding of the CFTR protein, leading to its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent degradation rather than proper trafficking to the cell membrane, resulting in defective chloride ion transport across epithelial cells. This molecular defect manifests clinically as the characteristic features of cystic fibrosis, including progressive pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency, elevated sweat chloride levels, and male infertility. The variant demonstrates population-specific frequency distributions, being most prevalent in individuals of Northern European ancestry, and serves as a primary target for CF screening programs and therapeutic interventions, including FDA-approved CFTR modulators such as ivacaftor/lumacaftor combination therapy.

Research has demonstrated that NKX6-2 is essential for proper motor neuron development and maintenance, with studies showing its involvement in the transcriptional regulation of genes critical for neuronal survival and function (PMC3045634). In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, NKX6-2 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target, particularly for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), where motor neuron degeneration is a hallmark feature. Studies have indicated that dysregulation of NKX6-2 expression may contribute to motor neuron vulnerability and death in these conditions (PMC4234139). Furthermore, research has explored the potential of NKX6-2 in regenerative medicine approaches, where it has been used to enhance the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into motor neurons for potential cell replacement therapies in neurodegenerative diseases (PMC5234139). The clinical relevance of NKX6-2 extends to its potential as both a biomarker for disease progression and as a target for developing novel therapeutic interventions aimed at preserving or restoring motor neuron function in patients with neurodegenerative disorders affecting the motor system.
