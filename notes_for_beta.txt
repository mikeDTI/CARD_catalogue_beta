Below is the inventory of beta files to catalogue:
    datasets are described in the file dataset-inventory-June_20_2025.tab
    github repositories are described in the file github_repos_20250622_150029.tab
    publications are in the file pubmed_central_20250622_150029.tab
    A new addition is the biorepositories described in the file iNDI_inventory_20250622_150029.tab

We need to clean up the app, swapping knowledge graphs for sematic search throughout.
We also need to make a biorepository page for the new dataset we have built for iNDI.
Also, post filtering, each tab should have an AI explainer of the final table and the semantic search results. With a private key that won't be seen on the public github.
Let's also fix the colors of the app to always be black with white text and neon blue highlights.

We also need to update the readme file.
