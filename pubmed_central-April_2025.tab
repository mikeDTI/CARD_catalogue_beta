Spatiotemporal coarse-to-fine diffusion model for automatic brain network generation.	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a transformative tool in analyzing and understanding brain diseases. It is a challenge to learn effective features from the high-dimensional fMRI. Most studies have focused on extracting connectivity-based features for disease analysis. However, they heavily rely on the software toolboxes to construct connectivity-based features, which may suffer from large errors because of different manual parameter settings and thus lead to bad performance in brain disorder analysis. A novel brain denoiser model is proposed to transform four-dimensional fMRI (4D fMRI) into a brain network in a unified framework for brain disease analysis. By introducing anatomical knowledge, the proposed model first reduces the 4D fMRI into a 2D coarse region-of-interest(ROI)-based time series and then diffuses it into noisy status by gradually adding Gaussian noise. Moreover, the coarse-to-fine transformer refinement is designed to capture multi-scale temporal dynamics and iteratively remove unrelated multi-frequency noise. Besides, the low-frequency preservation module is devised to enhance the effective signal at low frequencies during the denoising process. This can improve the signal-to-noise ratio at each timestep, which ensures accurate restoration of ROI time series and improves the performance of brain network construction. We evaluate the performance of the Brain Denoiser on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, demonstrating its ability to effectively suppress noise while preserving the underlying neural signals. Comparative analyses with related competing methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model. Generally, the proposed model presents a robust and innovative solution for brain network generation, paving the way for efficient analysis of brain disease.	brain imaging; brain network; coarse‐to‐fine diffusion model

Deep learning-based hippocampus asymmetry assessment for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.	The symmetry of the brain hippocampus may be disrupted by natural aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, clinical studies on hippocampus asymmetry are limited to subjective visual evaluation and rough volume measurements, lacking quantitative standards. This paper proposes a quantitative assessment method of the hippocampus asymmetry based on deep learning, named DeepHAA (Deep Learning-based Hippocampus Asymmetry Assessment). The DeepHAA model extracts feature representations of left and right hippocampus structures in MRI images and achieved feature fusion through a cross-attention mechanism. A quantitative assessment method is proposed based on the distance between the multimodal embedding of the input sample and the reference embedding space. The experimental dataset of this paper included MRI scans of 199 subjects, including 53 normal cognition (NC), 71 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 33 Alzheimer's disease (AD). The experimental results show that DeepHAA model can effectively identify and distinguish the NC, MCI, and AD. The proposed deep learning method integrates asymmetric information about hippocampus structure into the diagnosis of AD and has potential clinical application value.

Mounting evidence implicates inflammation as a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. We previously identified pro-inflammatory soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) metabolites to be elevated in plasma and CSF of AD patients and to be associated with lower cognition in non-AD subjects. Soluble epoxide hydrolase is a key enzyme converting anti-inflammatory epoxy fatty acids to pro-inflammatory diols, reported to be elevated in multiple cardiometabolic disorders. Here we analyzed over 700 fasting plasma samples from the baseline of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2/GO study. We applied targeted mass spectrometry method to provide absolute quantifications of over 150 metabolites from oxylipin and endocannabinoids pathway, interrogating the role for inflammation/immune dysregulation and the key enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase in AD. We provide further insights into the regulation of this pathway in different disease stages, APOE genotypes and between sexes. Additionally, we investigated in mild cognitive impaired (MCI) patients, metabolic signatures that inform about resilience to progression and conversion to AD. Key findings include I) confirmed disruption in this key central pathway of inflammation and pointed to dysregulation of sEH in AD with sex and disease stage differences; II) identified markers of disease progression and cognitive resilience using sex and ApoE genotype stratified analysis highlighting an important role for bile acids, lipid peroxidation and stress response hormone cortisol. In conclusion, we provide molecular insights into a central pathway of inflammation and links to cognitive dysfunction, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches that are based on targeting inflammation tailored for subgroups of individuals based on their sex, APOE genotype and their metabolic profile.

Analyzing heterogeneity in Alzheimer disease using multimodal normative modeling on imaging-based ATN biomarkers.	Previous studies have applied normative modeling on a single neuroimaging modality to investigate Alzheimer disease (AD) heterogeneity. We employed a deep learning-based multimodal normative framework to analyze individual-level variation across ATN (amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration) imaging biomarkers. We selected cross-sectional discovery (n = 665) and replication cohorts (n = 430) with available T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), amyloid, and tau positron emission tomography (PET). Normative modeling estimated individual-level abnormal deviations in amyloid-positive individuals compared to amyloid-negative controls. Regional abnormality patterns were mapped at different clinical group levels to assess intra-group heterogeneity. An individual-level disease severity index (DSI) was calculated using both the spatial extent and magnitude of abnormal deviations across ATN. Greater intra-group heterogeneity in ATN abnormality patterns was observed in more severe clinical stages of AD. Higher DSI was associated with worse cognitive function and increased risk of disease progression. Subject-specific abnormality maps across ATN reveal the heterogeneous impact of AD on the brain. Normative modeling examined AD heterogeneity across multimodal imaging biomarkers. Heterogeneity in spatial patterns of gray matter atrophy, amyloid, and tau burden. Higher within-group heterogeneity for AD patients at advanced dementia stages. Patient-specific metric summarized extent of neurodegeneration and neuropathology. Metric is a marker of poor brain health and can monitor risk of disease progression.

Distinct patterns of cognitive traits in extreme old age and Alzheimer's disease.	Clinical features of cognitive performance in extreme old age differ from those of pathological cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We compared cognitive traits between 638 centenarians aged 100-115 years and 208 and 221 patients with AD from independent facilities. The presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele did not affect Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in centenarians. Centenarians retained the ability to follow three consecutive commands, associated with their educational background and activities of daily living. Cognitive retention remained unchanged in semi-supercentenarians (aged ≥ 105 years) and supercentenarians (aged ≥110 years). A quantitative genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified two loci associated with maintaining the ability to follow three consecutive commands. This is the first study to compare cognitive traits between >600 centenarians and patients with AD. Centenarians attained higher MMSE scores for the phenotype of following three consecutive commands than patients with AD, being useful in clinical practice. Cognitive phenotypes in centenarians differ from those in the AD groups Clinical trait to follow consecutive instructions is retained in centenarians but not in AD groups GWAS identified SNPs related to the maintained trait of MMSE in centenarians.

The CentiMarker project: Standardizing quantitative Alzheimer's disease fluid biomarkers for biologic interpretation.	Biomarkers play a crucial role in understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and treatment effects. However, comparing biomarker measures without standardization and appreciating their magnitude relative to the disease can be challenging. To address this issue, we propose the CentiMarker approach, similar to Centiloid, which provides a standardized scale between normal (0) and nearly maximum abnormal AD (100) ranges. We applied this scale to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in dominantly inherited AD and sporadic AD cohorts. CentiMarkers facilitated the interpretation of disease abnormality, demonstrating comparable changes and distributions of AD biomarkers across disease stages. CentiMarkers make the treatment effect more comparable than their original scales across various biomarkers. The versatility of CentiMarkers makes it a valuable tool for standardized biomarker comparison in AD research, enabling informed cross-study comparisons and contributing to accelerated therapeutic development. Adoption of the CentiMarker scale could enhance biomarker reporting and advance our understanding of AD. Comparing fluid biomarkers without appreciating their magnitude relative to the disease can be challenging. We propose a CentiMarker metric to standardize biomarker measures from normal (0) and nearly maximum abnormal AD (100) ranges. CentiMarkers make the treatment effect more comparable across various biomarkers than when using the original scales.	Alzheimer's disease; CentiMarker; biomarker standardization; fluid biomarker

A genetically informed brain atlas for enhancing brain imaging genomics.	Brain imaging genomics has manifested considerable potential in illuminating the genetic determinants of human brain structure and function. This has propelled us to develop the GIANT (Genetically Informed brAiN aTlas) that accounts for genetic and neuroanatomical variations simultaneously. Integrating voxel-wise heritability and spatial proximity, GIANT clusters brain voxels into genetically informed regions, while retaining fundamental anatomical knowledge. Compared to conventional (non-genetics) brain atlases, GIANT exhibits smaller intra-region variations and larger inter-region variations in terms of voxel-wise heritability. As a result, GIANT yields increased regional SNP heritability, enhanced polygenicity, and its polygenic risk score explains more brain volumetric variation than traditional neuroanatomical brain atlases. We provide extensive validation to GIANT and demonstrate its neuroanatomical validity, confirming its generalizability across populations with diverse genetic ancestries and various brain conditions. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive genetic architecture of the GIANT regions, covering their functional annotation at the molecular levels, their associations with other complex traits/diseases, and the genetic and phenotypic correlations among GIANT-defined imaging endophenotypes. In summary, GIANT constitutes a brain atlas that captures the complexity of genetic and neuroanatomical heterogeneity, thereby enhancing the discovery power and applicability of imaging genomics investigations in biomedical science.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that requires early diagnosis for effective management. However, issues with currently available diagnostic biomarkers preclude early diagnosis, necessitating the development of alternative biomarkers and methods, such as blood-based diagnostics. We propose c-Triadem (constrained triple-input Alzheimer's disease model), a novel deep neural network to identify potential blood-based biomarkers for AD and predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD with high accuracy. The model utilizes genotyping data, gene expression data, and clinical information to predict the disease status of participants, i.e., cognitively normal (CN), MCI, or AD. The nodes of the neural network represent genes and their related pathways, and the edges represent known relationships among the genes and pathways. Simulated data validation further highlights the robustness of key features identified by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). We trained the model with blood genotyping data, microarray, and clinical features from the Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Disease Initiative (ADNI). We demonstrate that our model's performance is superior to previous models with an AUC of 97% and accuracy of 89%. We then identified the most influential genes and clinical features for prediction using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Our SHAP analysis shows that CASP9, LCK, and SDC3 SNPs and PINK1, ATG5, and ubiquitin (UBB, UBC) expression have a higher impact on model performance. Our model has facilitated the identification of potential blood-based genetic markers of DNA damage response and mitophagy in affected regions of the brain. The model can be used for detection and biomarker identification in other related dementias.

Single-Index Measurement Error Jump Regression Model in Alzheimer's Disease Studies.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia in the elderly, and investigations on the impact of risk factors on neurocognitive performance are crucial in preventative treatment. While existing statistical regression models, such as single-index models, have proven effective tools for uncovering the relationship between the neurocognitive scores and covariates of interest such as demographic information, clinical variables, and neuroimaging features, limited research has explored scenarios where jump discontinuities exist in the regression patterns and the covariates are unobservable but measured with errors, which are common in real applications. To address these challenges, we propose a single-index measurement error jump regression model (SMEJRM) that can handle both jump discontinuities and measurement errors in image covariates introduced by different image processing software. This development is motivated by data from 168 patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We establish both the estimation procedure and the corresponding asymptotic results. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of our SMEJRM and the estimation procedure. The real application reveals that jump discontinuities do exist in the relationship between neurocognitive scores and some covariates of interest in this study.

Measuring time saved in Alzheimer's disease: What is a meaningful slowing of progression?	Minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have previously been estimated using clinician-based anchors. However, MCIDs have been criticized for not reflecting the preferences of people living with AD (PLWAD). Furthermore, interpretations of clinical trial results have been criticized for conflating within-person meaningfulness thresholds and between-group differences. Here, we simulate scenarios of disease slowing and compare those to published MCIDs. Scenarios of 5%-95% disease slowing were simulated using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data. Time saved and point differences on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) were estimated for these scenarios and compared to published MCIDs. Scenario analyses resulted in estimates of time saved at ∼3 weeks-17 months and mean changes at 0.08-1.5 CDR-SB points over 18 months. The often referenced MCID for mild cognitive impairment (0.98) thereby corresponded to 11 months slowing, whereas the MCID for mild dementia (1.63) corresponded to >17 months slowing. Translating trial endpoints to estimates of time saved supports that often-referenced MCIDs may not be aligned with realistic and meaningful slowing of clinical progression. AD slowing of clinical progression by 5%-95% resulted in 0.74-17 months saved and 0.08-1.5 CDR-SB points change at 18 months.Slowing of at least 60% or 11 months of time saved over 18 months met an often-cited MCID threshold of 0.98 points for mild cognitive impairment.For mild AD dementia, an MCID of 1.63 meant that even an 18-month delay over 18 months would be considered only borderline meaningful-a face invalid and unrealistic proposition.

Brain amyloid imaging has become a crucial tool in diagnosing and understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders. The introduction of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) with [¹¹C]Pittsburgh Compound-B ([¹¹C]PiB) in the early 2000s marked a breakthrough in visualizing amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in vivo. Subsequent development of ¹⁸F-labeled tracers, such as [¹⁸F]florbetapir, [¹⁸F]flutemetamol, and [¹⁸F]florbetaben, improved accessibility and extended imaging capabilities. However, global adoption remains uneven due to disparities in healthcare infrastructure, costs, and regulatory frameworks. In high-income countries, amyloid PET is increasingly used in clinical workflows, particularly for differentiating atypical dementia cases and selecting patients for anti-amyloid therapies like aducanumab and lecanemab. Despite its high sensitivity and specificity, challenges persist regarding its clinical utility, particularly in cognitively normal individuals with amyloid accumulation. Research is focusing on integrating amyloid PET with other biomarkers-tau PET, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and plasma assays-to improve diagnostic accuracy. Geographical variations in amyloid PET research and implementation reveal North America and Europe as leaders, while access remains limited in low- and middle-income countries. Efforts such as the Worldwide Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative aim to enhance global standardization and accessibility. Emerging trends in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted imaging analysis and next-generation tracers promise further improvements. Addressing ethical concerns related to preclinical screening and ensuring equitable access to amyloid PET are critical for optimizing its role in neurology and nuclear medicine worldwide.

Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI)-derived brain-age prediction is a promising biomarker of biological brain aging. Accelerated brain aging has been found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, no previous studies have investigated the relationship between specific pathophysiological pathways in AD and biological brain aging. Here, we studied whether glial reactivity and synaptic dysfunction are associated with biological brain aging in the earliest stages of the Alzheimer's continuum, and if these mechanisms are differently associated with AD-related cortical atrophy. We further evaluated their effects on cognitive decline. We included 380 cognitively unimpaired individuals from the ALFA+ study, for which we computed their brain-age deltas by subtracting chronological age from their brain age predicted by machine learning algorithms. We studied the cross-sectional linear associations between brain-age delta and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction (neurogranin, GAP43, synaptotagmin-1, SNAP25, and α-synuclein), glial reactivity (sTREM2, YKL-40, GFAP, and S100b) and inflammation (interleukin-6). We also studied the cross-sectional linear associations between AD signature and these CSF biomarkers, We further evaluated the mechanisms linking baseline brain-age delta and longitudinal cognitive decline by performing mediation analyses. To reproduce our findings on an independent cohort, we included 152 cognitively unimpaired and 310 mild cognitive impaired (MCI) individuals from the ADNI study. We found that higher CSF sTREM2 was associated with a younger brain-age after adjusting for AD pathology, both in ALFA+ cognitively unimpaired and in ADNI MCI individuals. Furthermore, we found that CSF sTREM2 fully mediated the link between older brain-age and cognitive decline in ALFA+. In summary, we showed that the protective microglial state reflected by higher CSF sTREM2 has a beneficial impact on biological brain aging that may partly explains the variability in cognitive decline in early AD stages, independently of AD pathology.

Poor glymphatic function is associated with mild cognitive impairment and its progression to Alzheimer's disease: A DTI-ALPS study.	We aimed to explore the association between ALPS index and both risks of MCI from cognitively normal (CN) and incident AD progressed from MCI, as well as potential mediating factors. This study included 519 adults including 253 (48.75 %) CN and 266 (51.25 %) MCI participants from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Glymphatic function (assessed by along the perivascular space [ALPS] index) was measured by diffusion tensor image at baseline. Neurobiomarkers (Aβ and tau from CSF, plasma and PET) and cognitive functions were served as mediators. Data were analyzed using Cox and Laplace regression and mediation analysis. During follow-up (median 3.6 years, interquartile range [IQR]: 2.0-4.9 years), 30 (11.86 %) participants developed MCI in the CN cohort and 73 (27.4 %) participants progressed to AD in the MCI cohort. The hazard ratios (95 % confidence intervals [CIs]) of the higher ALPS index was 0.605 (0.386-0.948) for MCI and 0.501 (0.356-0.706) for AD. In addition, participants with high ALPS index had 3.837 and 3.466 years prolonged onset of MCI and AD, separately. Aβ in choroid plexus (17.1 %), tau in cortex [Inferiortemporal (21.1 %), Middletemporal (AV1451:17.0 %, FTP:15.5 %), Superiortemporal(7.7 %), Meta_temporal (AV1451:17.5 %, FTP:16.6 %)], and executive function (14.1 %) mediated the association between ALPS and MCI-AD progression. High ALPS index decreases MCI risk and delays MCI progression to AD by approximately 3.5 years. Aβ in choroid plexus, tau in cortex, and executive function may partially mediate the MCI-AD progression in relation to ALPS index.

The effect of Alzheimer's disease genetic factors on limbic white matter microstructure.	White matter (WM) microstructure is essential for brain function but deteriorates with age and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diffusion MRI, enhanced by advanced bi-tensor models accounting for free water (FW), enables in vivo quantification of WM microstructural differences. To evaluate how AD genetic risk factors affect limbic WM microstructure - crucial for memory and early impacted in disease - we conducted linear regression analyses in a cohort of 2,614 non-Hispanic White aging adults (aged 50.12 to 100.85 years). The study evaluated 36 AD risk variants across 26 genes, the association between AD polygenic scores (PGSs) and WM metrics, and interactions with cognitive status. AD PGSs, variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and apolipoprotein E (APOE), and interactions involving MS4A6A were significantly linked to WM microstructure. These findings implicate AD-related genetic factors related to neurodevelopment (WNT3), lipid metabolism (APOE), and inflammation (TMEM106B, PTK2B, MS4A6A) that contribute to alternations in WM microstructure in older adults. AD risk variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and APOE genes showed distinct associations with limbic FW-corrected WM microstructure metrics. Interaction effects were observed between MS4A6A variants and cognitive status. PGS for AD was associated with higher FW content in the limbic system.

In ADNI, AD A+T- showed higher early-stage tau binding compared to both control groups and more late-stage tau compared to CU A-T-, but no tau accumulation over time. VR tau-PET-negative AD patients show neurodegenerative and cognitive processes consistent with the AD trajectory, but milder progression compared to tau-PET-positive AD patients. We used the novel Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved VR method for defining tau-PET positivity. AD A+T- patients were older and showed less atrophy and cognitive decline than AD A+T+. We did not find convincing evidence of tau accumulation in AD A+T- or copathologies. The group of AD A+T- patients is likely very heterogeneous.

Atrophy trajectories in Alzheimer's disease: how sex matters.	Longitudinal subtypes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified based on their distinct brain atrophy trajectories, encompassing mediotemporal and cortical pathways. These subtypes include minimal atrophy, limbic predominant, limbic predominant plus, diffuse atrophy and hippocampal sparing. The impact of sex on the progression of these subtypes remains a crucial area of investigation. We analysed MRI data from 320 amyloid-β positive individuals with AD from three international cohorts (ADNI, J-ADNI and AIBL). Longitudinal clustering was conducted to identify atrophy trajectories over eight years from the clinical disease onset, with separate trajectories delineated for women and men. Women consistently exhibited earlier hippocampal atrophy and a higher burden of white matter abnormalities compared to men, yet women displayed less cognitive decline over time. Additionally, specific risk factors and distinct neuropsychiatric symptoms were associated with sex within specific trajectories. AD subtypes show sex-specific differences in disease progression, highlighting the need to account for these differences from the early disease stages. Integrating imaging biomarkers with sex differences can enable the identification of more precise treatments for each patient, ensuring that both women and men have equal access to tailored care.

Blood-brain barrier biomarkers modulate the associations of peripheral immunity with Alzheimer's disease.	The association between peripheral immunity and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been increasingly recognized, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We used multiple linear regression models to explore the association between peripheral immune biomarkers / blood-brain barrier (BBB)-related biomarkers and AD biomarkers. And we used causal mediation analysis with 10,000 bootstrapped iterations to investigate the functions of BBB-related biomarkers in mediating the associations between peripheral immune biomarkers and AD pathology, cerebral atrophy degree, as well as cognitive function. A total of 543 participants (38.7% female, mean age of 74.8 years) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were involved. Neutrophils percent (NEU%), lymphocytes percent (LYM%), neutrophils / lymphocytes (NLR), and chemotactic factor-3 (CCL26) were significantly associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid-42 (Aβ-42), phosphorylated-tau (P-tau), total tau (T-tau)/Aβ-42 and P-tau/Aβ-42, the associations of NEU% with AD pathology were mediated by CCL26 (proportion: 18-24%; p < 0.05). NEU%, LYM%, NLR, CCL26, CD40 and matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP10) were significantly associated with whole brain, hippocampal volume, middle temporal lobe (MTL) volume, and entorhinal cortex (EC) thickness, the associations of peripheral immune biomarkers with cerebral atrophy degree were mediated by BBB-related biomarkers (proportion: 7-17%; p < 0.05). NEU%, LYM%, NLR, CCL26, CD40 and MMP10 were significantly associated with global cognition, executive function, memory function, immediate recall, and delayed recall, the associations of peripheral immune biomarkers with cognitive function were mediated by BBB-related biomarkers (proportion: 9-24%; p < 0.05). This study suggests that peripheral immunity may influence AD through influencing BBB function, providing a more robust and comprehensive evidence chain for the potential role of inflammation in AD.

Exploring the power of MRI and clinical measures in predicting AD neuropathology.	Predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology prior to clinical diagnosis is important for identifying individuals at high risk of developing AD dementia. However, there remains a gap in leveraging MRI and clinical data to predict AD pathology. This study examines a novel machine learning approach that integrates the combined vascular (white matter hyperintensities, WMHs) and structural brain changes (gray matter, GM) with clinical factors (cognitive scores) to predict post-mortem neuropathology. Participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset (ADNI) and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) with both post-mortem neuropathology data and antemortem MRI and clinical data were included. Machine learning models were applied towards feature selection of the top seven MRI, clinical, and demographic data to identify the best performing set of variables that could predict postmortem neuropathology outcomes (i.e., neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, senile/amyloid plaques, and amyloid angiopathy). The best-performing neuropathology predictors from ADNI were then validated in NACC to compare results and ensure that the feature selection process did not lead to overfitting. In ADNI, the best-performing model included total and temporal lobe WMHs and achieved r = 0.87(RMSE = 0.62) during cross-validation for neuritic plaques. Overall, post-mortem neuropathology outcomes were predicted up to 14 years before death with high accuracies (~ 90%). Similar results were observed in the NACC dataset. These findings highlight that MRI features are critical to successfully predict AD-related pathology years in advance.

Intracellular alpha-synuclein aggregates, known as Lewy bodies (LB), are commonly observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Post-mortem studies have shown a higher frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms among individuals with AD and LB co-pathology. However, the effects of in vivo-measured LB pathology on neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD remain underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of in vivo-measured LB pathology on neuropsychiatric symptoms across the AD continuum. We analyzed data from 1,169 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants had in vivo measures of LB pathology (assessed using an alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay), amyloid-beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and neuropsychiatric symptoms evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess cross-sectional and longitudinal effects, respectively, adjusting for age, sex, and cognitive status. Participants had a mean baseline age of 73.05 (SD 7.22) years, 47.13% were women, 426 (36.44%) cognitively unimpaired, and 743 (63.56%) cognitively impaired. In cross-sectional analyses, LB pathology was associated with higher rates of anxiety, apathy, motor disturbances, and appetite disturbances. In longitudinal analyses, LB pathology increased the risk of developing psychosis and anxiety. These effects were independent of Aβ and p-tau. Our results suggest that in vivo-measured LB pathology is closely associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms across the AD continuum. These findings underscore the potential of in vivo LB detection as a marker for identifying individuals at increased risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms, both in clinical trials and in clinical practice.

An imaging and genetic-based deep learning network for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.	Conventional computer-aided diagnostic techniques for Alzheimer's disease (AD) predominantly rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in isolation. Genetic imaging methods, by establishing the link between genes and brain structures in disease progression, facilitate early prediction of AD development. While deep learning methods based on MRI have demonstrated promising results for early AD diagnosis, the limited dataset size has led most AD studies to lean on statistical approaches within the realm of imaging genetics. Existing deep-learning approaches typically utilize pre-defined regions of interest and risk variants from known susceptibility genes, employing relatively straightforward feature fusion methods that fail to fully capture the relationship between images and genes. To address these limitations, we proposed a multi-modal deep learning classification network based on MRI and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for AD diagnosis and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression prediction. Our model leveraged a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract whole-brain structural features, a Transformer network to capture genetic features, and employed a cross-transformer-based network for comprehensive feature fusion. Furthermore, we incorporated an attention-map-based interpretability method to analyze and elucidate the structural and risk variants associated with AD and their interrelationships. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using 1,541 subjects from the ADNI database. Experimental results underscored the superior performance of our model in effectively integrating and leveraging information from both modalities, thus enhancing the accuracy of AD diagnosis and prediction.

Addressing overfitting bias due to sample overlap in polygenic risk scoring.	Numerous studies on Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk scores (PRSs) overlook sample overlap between International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and target datasets like Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To address this, we developed overlap-adjusted PRS (OA PRS) and tested it on simulated data to assess biases from different scenarios by varying training, testing, and overlap proportions. OA PRS was used to adjust for sample bias in simulations; then, we applied OA PRS to IGAP and ADNI datasets and validated through visual diagnosis. OA PRS effectively adjusted for sample overlap in all simulation scenarios, as well as for IGAP and ADNI. The original IGAP PRS showed an inflated area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC: 0.915) on overlapping samples. OA PRS reduced the AUROC to 0.726, closely aligning with the AUROC of non-overlapping samples (0.712). Further, visual diagnostics confirmed the effectiveness of our adjustments. With OA PRS, we were able to adjust the IGAP summary-based PRS for the overlapped ADNI samples, allowing the dataset to be fully used without the risk of overfitting. Sample overlap between large Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohorts poses overfitting bias when using AD polygenic risk scores (PRSs). This study highlighted the effectiveness of overlap-adjusted PRS (OA -PRS) in mitigating overfitting and improving the accuracy of PRS estimations. New PRSs based on adjusted effect sizes showed increased power in association with clinical features.

Associations among Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, Neuroinflammation, and Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Non-Dementia Adults.	Recent studies have identified the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene as a potential candidate influencing Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. It is crucial to investigate the impact of ACE on AD pathology and its underlying mechanisms. A total of 450 non-demented participants from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with data on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ACE, AD core biomarkers and inflammation-related biomarkers were included. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the associations among CSF ACE, AD core biomarkers and inflammation-related biomarkers. And we used the mediation models to investigate the potential mechanisms through which ACE influenced AD pathology. The results of multiple linear regression were shown that CSF ACE was significantly correlated with CSF Aβ	Alzheimer’s disease; Angiotensin-converting enzyme; Cerebrospinal fluid; Neuroinflammation

Cerebrospinal fluid Visinin-like protein-1 was associated with the relationship of body mass index with Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognition in non-demented elderly.	The relationship and mechanisms between body mass index (BMI) and cognition are complex and inconclusive. Additionally, the role of neuronal calcium dysfunction, reflected by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1), in the mechanisms linked with BMI and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been investigated. To investigate the relationship between CSF VILIP-1, BMI, and AD pathologies in non-demented elderly at early stages of AD. Baseline CSF AD core biomarkers (amyloid-β The average age of participants was 72.6. CSF VILIP-1 was decreased in A+/TN- (A-positive/T- and N- negative) group and elevated in A-/TN + (A-negative/T- or N-positive) and A+/TN + groups, as compared with A-/TN- group. In total participants, BMI was negatively related to CSF P-tau, T-tau, P-tau/Aβ Our findings indicated that CSF VILIP-1 changed dynamically and might be a key mediator in the associations between BMI and tau pathology, providing new insights into understanding the mechanisms underlying BMI-related cognitive deficits in non-demented elderly.

Analysis of human brain RNA-seq data reveals combined effects of 4 types of RNA modifications and 18 types of programmed cell death on Alzheimer's disease.	RNA modification plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by modulating the expression and function of AD-related genes, thereby affecting AD occurrence and progression. Programmed cell death is closely related to neuronal death and associated with neuronal loss and cognitive function changes in AD. However, the mechanism of their joint action on AD remains unknown and requires further exploration. We used the MSBB RNA-seq dataset to analyze the correlation between RNA modification, programmed cell death, and AD. We used combined studies of RNA modification and programmed cell death to distinguish subgroups of patients, and the results highlight the strong correlation between RNA modification-related programmed cell death and AD. A weighted gene co-expression network was constructed, and the pivotal roles of programmed cell death genes in key modules were identified. Finally, by combining unsupervised consensus clustering, gene co-expression networks, and machine learning algorithms, an RNA modification-related programmed cell death network was constructed, and the pivotal roles of programmed cell death genes in key modules were identified. An RNA modification-related programmed cell death risk score was calculated to predict the occurrence of AD. RPCD-related genes classified patients into subgroups with distinct clinical characteristics. Nineteen key genes were identified and an RPCD risk score was constructed based on the key genes. This score can be used for the diagnosis of AD and the assessment of disease progression in patients. The diagnostic efficacy of the RPCD risk score and the key genes was validated in the ROSMAP, GEO, and ADNI datasets. This study uncovered that RNA modification-related PCD is of significance for AD progression and early prediction, providing insights from a new perspective for the study of disease mechanisms in AD.

Human lifespan changes in the brain's functional connectome.	Functional connectivity of the human brain changes through life. Here, we assemble task-free functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 33,250 individuals at 32 weeks of postmenstrual age to 80 years from 132 global sites. We report critical inflection points in the nonlinear growth curves of the global mean and variance of the connectome, peaking in the late fourth and late third decades of life, respectively. After constructing a fine-grained, lifespan-wide suite of system-level brain atlases, we show distinct maturation timelines for functional segregation within different systems. Lifespan growth of regional connectivity is organized along a spatiotemporal cortical axis, transitioning from primary sensorimotor regions to higher-order association regions. These findings elucidate the lifespan evolution of the functional connectome and can serve as a normative reference for quantifying individual variation in development, aging and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Association of cerebrospinal fluid ciliary neurotrophic factor levels with cognitive decline and disease progression.	BackgroundCiliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) has been identified as a neuroprotective cytokine that can alleviate cognitive impairment in preclinical studies, although the association of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CNTF levels with cognitive decline and disease progression in living humans remains unclear.ObjectiveThis study aimed to explore the association between baseline CSF CNTF levels and the rate of cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired (CU) and cognitively impaired (CI) older people respectively.MethodsA total of 667 participants were included in the study, comprising 161 CU and 506 CI individuals, with an average follow-up time of 3.97 years (SD = 2.99). Linear mixed-effects models were fitted with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores as the primary outcome. As sensitivity analyses, we used another three commonly used cognitive measures as secondary outcomes to test the robustness of our findings. In addition, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subgroup to investigate the association between baseline CSF CNTF levels and the progression from MCI to dementia.ResultsWe observed that higher baseline CSF CNTF levels were linked with a slower rate of cognitive decline in the CI group, while this association was absent in the CU group. These findings were consistent across different cognitive measures. Among MCI participants, higher levels of CSF CNTF were associated with a slower rate of disease progression to dementia.ConclusionsThe association between CSF CNTF levels and both cognitive decline and disease progression highlights the potential of CNTF as a therapeutic target in the context of Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive disorders.

Predicting progression of mild cognitive impairment patients through four distinctive subgroups obtained by unsupervised learning algorithms.	BackgroundMild cognitive impairment (MCI) exhibits considerable heterogeneity, requiring accurate characterization through classification and prognostic models. In clinical research, data-driven models offer valuable insights for classification, stratification, and predicting progression to dementia.ObjectiveWe implemented computational techniques to characterize MCI patients and develop multistate progression models for Alzheimer's disease (AD).MethodsDatasets comprising 544 MCI patients from Coimbra University Hospital and 497 from the ADNI, were processed using machine learning techniques, including dimensionality reduction and partition clustering algorithms. For longitudinal measures (n = 351), multistate non-Markov was applied to generate transition probability estimates.ResultsOur analyses gave 4 possible subgroups of MCI patients: 1) increased cognitive reserve, 2) suspected AD pathology, 3) psychological manifestations, and 4) cardiovascular risk factors. Progression within these subgroups showed variations. The likelihood of progressing to AD dementia was estimated over a range of 5 months for those with suspected AD pathology and 66 months for those with psychological manifestations.ConclusionsOur findings support the significance of computational methods to improve the characterization and prognosis of MCI patients. We suggest that these four MCI subgroups should be considered for clinical monitoring.	Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; data science; machine learning; prognosis

Integrative network analysis reveals novel moderators of Aβ-Tau interaction in Alzheimer's disease.	Although interactions between amyloid-beta and tau proteins have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the precise mechanisms by which these interactions contribute to disease progression are not yet fully understood. Moreover, despite the growing application of deep learning in various biomedical fields, its application in integrating networks to analyze disease mechanisms in AD research remains limited. In this study, we employed BIONIC, a deep learning-based network integration method, to integrate proteomics and protein-protein interaction data, with an aim to uncover factors that moderate the effects of the Aβ-tau interaction on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage AD. Proteomic data from the ROSMAP cohort were integrated with protein-protein interaction (PPI) data using a Deep Learning-based model. Linear regression analysis was applied to histopathological and gene expression data, and mutual information was used to detect moderating factors. Statistical significance was determined using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (p < 0.05). Our results suggested that astrocytes and GPNMB + microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction. Based on linear regression with histopathological and gene expression data, GFAP and IBA1 levels and GPNMB gene expression positively contributed to the interaction of tau with Aβ in non-dementia cases, replicating the results of the network analysis. These findings suggest that GPNMB + microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction in early AD and therefore are a novel therapeutic target. To facilitate further research, we have made the integrated network available as a visualization tool for the scientific community (URL: https://igcore.cloud/GerOmics/AlzPPMap ).

Growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) predicts brain amyloidosis in Alzheimer's dementia continuum: an [	Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) is a key protein involved in neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity. Alterations in GAP-43 levels have been associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), potentially reflecting synaptic dysfunction. We evaluated the potential of GAP-43 as a biomarker for AD and explored its association with amyloid-beta (Aβ) levels, as well as its correlation with Aβ plaque burden in the brain. We screened 1,639 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. A total of 226 individuals met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled. Participants were classified into three groups: 77 cognitively normal (CN) individuals, 111 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 38 with a diagnosis of AD. The associations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GAP-43 levels with other biomarkers as well as [¹⁸F] AV-45 (Florbetapir) PET Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVR) were investigated. Our findings revealed significantly elevated CSF GAP-43 levels in individuals with AD compared to CN and MCI groups. Furthermore, GAP-43 levels showed a significant positive correlation with tau pathology. Notably, we observed a significant association between GAP-43 and [¹⁸F] Florbetapir PET SUVR in the MCI group, suggesting that GAP-43 may serve as a reliable biomarker in the early stages of AD. This study provides evidence supporting the role of GAP-43 as a potential biomarker for AD, particularly in relation to predicting the amyloid pathology pattern in the brain in the MCI stage.

Voxel-wise insights into early Alzheimer's disease pathology progression: the association with APOE and memory decline.	"Longitudinal investigation of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype's impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker progression, focusing on amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation and gray matter (GM) atrophy, integrating cognitive decline and baseline levels. Longitudinal florbetapir-PET and T1-weighted MRI data from 100 cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impaired (MCI) participants both with considerable global Aβ accumulation (""high Aβ accumulators"") were analyzed using a voxel-wise approach. Associations of APOE genotype and memory decline with Aβ accumulation and GM atrophy were examined separately for each neuroimaging modality, controlling for baseline Aβ levels and diagnosis. Alternatively, the effect of baseline diagnosis, while controlling for memory decline, was investigated. A multimodal analysis evaluated interactions between genotype, memory decline, and GM atrophy on Aβ accumulation. High Aβ accumulators displayed extensive Aβ pathology predominantly in the medial orbito-frontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and precuneus, along with GM atrophy in temporal, occipital, orbito-frontal, and parietal areas. ɛ4 carriers with memory decline exhibited greater Aβ accumulation and GM atrophy in selective regions compared to non-carriers with memory decline, while no genotype difference was observed in individuals without decline. No interaction effect was observed for MCI diagnosis. Regional associations between the two biomarkers were similarly dependent on genotype and memory decline. ɛ4 carriers exhibiting memory decline present an accelerated neurobiological pattern at predementia stages, supporting early ɛ4 carrier monitoring and interventions in this at-risk group. Importantly, memory decline might be more informative than MCI regarding AD pathology progression emphasizing the importance of repeated cognitive assessments."

This paper introduces a novel convolutional neural network model with an attention mechanism to advance Alzheimer disease (AD) classification using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The model architecture is meticulously crafted to enhance feature extraction and selectively focus on crucial regions within brain images, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. A unique component, the MRI Segmentation Block (MSB), is introduced to manage the skull stripping task effectively, highlighting the model ability to learn from complex, multilayered information. We have incorporated a detailed experimental evaluation of the MSB, demonstrating its superior performance in cranial debridement tasks compared to existing methods. The experiments involved a range of MRI scans, assessing the MSB's accuracy through metrics like the Dice Coefficient and Jaccard Index against ground truth annotations by expert radiologists. The results substantiate the MSB's effectiveness, setting a new benchmark for precision in medical imaging diagnostics. The proposed method integrates densely connected neural networks with a connection-wise attention model to extract multiscale features from MRI scans. Furthermore, the attention mechanism is fine-tuned to emphasize salient features significantly associated with various stages of Alzheimer's disease, thereby setting a new benchmark for precision in medical imaging diagnostics. Extensive experiments on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional and contemporary approaches, with our model achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes it suitable for clinical applications where resources are limited. This study represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic process for AD, with potential implications for improving patient outcomes in clinical settings.

A group based network analysis for Alzheimer's disease fMRI data.	Network modeling are widely using in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Typically, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was widely applied to construct brain connectivity network from BOLD signals of regions of interest. However, it often results in significant intra-group variability and complicates the identification of disease-specific functional connectivity patterns. To address this issue, we propose a novel brain network construction strategy, called SNBG, which uses aggregated information from the control group to derive a single-sample network. We compare SNBG and the PCC based method on a dataset from an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. SNBG method captures more stable connections between regions of interest (ROIs) and increases classification accuracy from 89.24% of PCC based method to 97.13%. In addition, in AD-related local networks, such as default mode network (DMN), medial frontal network (MFN) and frontoparietal network (FPN), SNBG demonstrates lower intra-group heterogeneity than the PCC based method.

Plasma protein risk scores for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in the Framingham heart study.	It is unclear whether aggregated plasma protein risk scores (PPRSs) could be useful in predicting the risks of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Cox proportional hazard model with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator penalty was used to build the PPRSs for MCI and AD in 1515 Framingham Heart Study Generation 2 with 1128 proteins measured in plasma at exam 5 (cognitively normal [CN] = 1258, MCI = 129, AD = 128). MCI PPRS had a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.97 [5.34, 9.12], with a discriminating power (C-index = 82.52%). AD PPRS had a HR of 5.74 [4.67, 7.05] (C-index = 88.15%). Both PPRSs were also significantly associated with cognitive changes, brain atrophy, and plasma AD biomarkers. Proteins in the MCI and AD PPRSs were involved in several pathways related to leukocyte, chemotaxis, immunity, inflammation, and cellular migration. This study suggests that PPRSs serve well to predict the risk of developing MCI and AD as well as cognitive changes and AD-related pathogenesis in the brain. PPRSs were developed for the risk of AD and AD preclinical stage, MCI. PPRSs were developed for MCI and AD associated with cognitive changes, loss of brain volume, and increasing level of plasma AD biomarkers. Leukocyte, chemotaxis, immunity, inflammation, and cellular migration enriched in proteins were identified as being involved in MCI and AD PPRSs.

Combination therapy targeting Alzheimer's disease risk factors is associated with a significant delay in Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive decline can be a major contributor to loss of independent living. Therapeutic strategies that alter the course of cognitive deterioration have the potential to sustain activities of daily living, promote quality of life, and delay transition to nursing-home care. We performed longitudinal linear regression analysis of National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) cognitive data from 7653 mild dementia AD participants at baseline with at least one medication for diabetes (DBMD), lipid-lowering (LIPL), anti-hypertensive (AHTN), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSD) medications or any combination in 5684 (74%) participants and in 1969 (26%) participants with no study-relevant prescriptions over 10 years. Change in cognitive function was determined by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Combination of DBMD+LIPL+AHTN+NSD (QuadRx) resulted in a significant 46% MMSE and 32% CDR-SB delay in cognitive decline at 5 years, which was sustained at 10 years with a delay in decline of 47% MMSE and 33% CDR-SB. QuadRx was equally effective for the delay of cognitive decline in both females and males at 5 and 10 years. QuadRx mitigated the impact of the Combination therapy was associated with a significant delay in cognitive decline in NACC AD participants at a magnitude comparable to or greater than amyloid beta immunomodulators. Further, the delay in decline was sustained for 10 years. The impact of QuadRx to delay cognitive decline was validated in deeply characterized ADNI participants. These data support combination therapy in persons with AD risk factors to alter the course of AD that persists for a decade, enabling cognitive function at a magnitude associated with independent living. QuadRx slowed Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive decline by 47% in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center NACC and 60% in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI participants.Combination therapy exhibited additive and synergistic slowing of cognitive decline.QuadRx was equally effective in females and males at 5 and 10 years.QuadRx mitigated the impact of the apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype.QuadRx was effective in AD participants reporting drug use for their AD risk factor.

Ensemble network using oblique coronal MRI for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary degenerative brain disorder commonly found in the elderly, Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be considered a transitional stage from normal aging to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, distinguishing between normal aging and disease-induced neurofunctional impairments is crucial in clinical treatment. Although deep learning methods have been widely applied in Alzheimer's diagnosis, the varying data formats used by different methods limited their clinical applicability. In this study, based on the ADNI dataset and previous clinical diagnostic experience, we propose a method using oblique coronal MRI to assist in diagnosis. We developed an algorithm to extract oblique coronal slices from 3D MRI data and used these slices to train classification networks. To achieve subject-wise classification based on 2D slices, rather than image-wise classification, we employed ensemble learning methods. This approach fused classification results from different modality images or different positions of the same modality images, constructing a more reliable ensemble classification model. The experiments introduced various decision fusion and feature fusion schemes, demonstrating the potential of oblique coronal MRI slices in assisting diagnosis. Notably, the weighted voting from decision fusion strategy trained on oblique coronal slices achieved accuracy rates of 97.5% for CN vs. AD, 100% for CN vs. MCI, and 94.83% for MCI vs. AD across the three classification tasks.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant global health challenges due to its increasing prevalence and associated societal costs. Early detection and diagnosis of AD are critical for delaying progression and improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods and single-modality data often fall short in identifying early-stage AD and distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel approach: multImodal enseMble via class BALancing diversity for iMbalancEd Data (IMBALMED). IMBALMED integrates multimodal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, including clinical assessments, neuroimaging phenotypes, biospecimen, and subject characteristics data. It employs a new ensemble of model classifiers, designed specifically for this framework, which combines eight distinct families of learning paradigms trained with diverse class balancing techniques to overcome class imbalance and enhance model accuracy. We evaluate IMBALMED on two diagnostic tasks (binary and ternary classification) and four binary early detection tasks (at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months), comparing its performance with state-of-the-art algorithms and an unbalanced dataset method. To further validate the proposed model and ensure genuine generalization to real-world scenarios, we conducted an external validation experiment using data from the most recent phase of the ADNI dataset. IMBALMED demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and predictive performance in both binary and ternary classification tasks, significantly improving early detection of MCI at a 48-month time point and showing excellent generalizability in the 12-month task during external validation. The method shows improved classification performance and robustness, offering a promising solution for early detection and management of AD.

AD-Diff: enhancing Alzheimer's disease prediction accuracy through multimodal fusion.	Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial to improving patient quality of life and treatment outcomes. However, current predictive methods face challenges such as insufficient multimodal information integration and the high cost of PET image acquisition, which limit their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative model, AD-Diff. This model significantly improves AD prediction accuracy by integrating PET images generated through a diffusion process with cognitive scale data and other modalities. Specifically, the AD-Diff model consists of two core components: the ADdiffusion module and the multimodal Mamba Classifier. The ADdiffusion module uses a 3D diffusion process to generate high-quality PET images, which are then fused with MRI images and tabular data to provide input for the Multimodal Mamba Classifier. Experimental results on the OASIS and ADNI datasets demonstrate that the AD-Diff model performs exceptionally well in both long-term and short-term AD prediction tasks, significantly improving prediction accuracy and reliability. These results highlight the significant advantages of the AD-Diff model in handling complex medical image data and multimodal information, providing an effective tool for the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease using artificial intelligence and cortical features on T1WI sequences.	Accurately predicting the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a challenging task, which is crucial for helping develop personalized treatment plans to improve prognosis. To develop new technology for the early prediction of AD using artificial intelligence and cortical features on MRI. A total of 162 MCI patients were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. By using a 3D-MPRAGE sequence, T1W images for each patient were acquired. All patients were randomly divided into a training set ( In the training group, the C-indexes of the network, morphology, network-clinical, morphology-clinical, morphology-network and morphology-network-clinical models were 0.834, 0.926, 0.915, 0.949, 0.928, and 0.951, respectively. The C-indexes of those models in the validation group were 0.765, 0.784, 0.849, 0.877, 0.884, and 0.880, respectively. The morphology-network-clinical model performed the best. A multi-predictor nomogram with high accuracy for individual AD prediction (C-index = 0.951) was established. The early occurrence of AD could be accurately predicted using our morphology-network-clinical model and the multi-predictor nomogram. This could help doctors make early and personalized treatment decisions in clinical practice, which showed important clinical significance.

Evaluating Traditional, Deep Learning and Subfield Methods for Automatically Segmenting the Hippocampus From MRI.	Given the relationship between hippocampal atrophy and cognitive impairment in various pathological conditions, hippocampus segmentation from MRI is an important task in neuroimaging. Manual segmentation, though considered the gold standard, is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to the development of numerous automatic segmentation methods. However, no study has yet independently compared the performance of traditional, deep learning-based and hippocampal subfield segmentation methods within a single investigation. We evaluated 10 automatic hippocampal segmentation methods (FreeSurfer, SynthSeg, FastSurfer, FIRST, e2dhipseg, Hippmapper, Hippodeep, FreeSurfer-Subfields, HippUnfold and HSF) across 3 datasets with manually segmented hippocampus labels. Performance metrics included overlap with manual labels, correlations between manual and automatic volumes, volume similarity, diagnostic group differentiation and systematically located false positives and negatives. Most methods, especially deep learning-based ones that were trained on manual labels, performed well on public datasets but showed more error and variability on clinical data. Many methods tended to over-segment, particularly at the anterior hippocampus border, but were able to distinguish between healthy controls, MCI, and dementia patients based on hippocampal volume. Our findings highlight the challenges in hippocampal segmentation from MRI and the need for more publicly accessible datasets with manual labels across diverse ages and pathological conditions.

Comparison of Deep Learning and Traditional Machine Learning Models for Predicting Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Plasma Proteomic Biomarkers.	"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical condition characterized by a decline in cognitive ability and progression of cognitive impairment. It is often considered a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to compare deep learning (DL) and traditional machine learning (ML) methods in predicting MCI using plasma proteomic biomarkers. A total of 239 adults were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort along with a pool of 146 plasma proteomic biomarkers. We evaluated seven traditional ML models (support vector machines (SVMs), logistic regression (LR), naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) and six variations of a deep neural network (DNN) model-the DL model in the H2O package. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) selected 35 proteomic biomarkers from the pool. Based on grid search, the DNN model with an activation function of ""Rectifier With Dropout"" with 2 layers and 32 of 35 selected proteomic biomarkers revealed the best model with the highest accuracy of 0.995 and an F1 Score of 0.996, while among seven traditional ML methods, XGBoost was the best with an accuracy of 0.986 and an F1 Score of 0.985.

Longitudinal Analysis of Amyloid PET and Brain MRI for Predicting Conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease: Findings from the ADNI Cohort.	This study aimed to investigate the predictive power of integrated longitudinal amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for determining the likelihood of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We included 180 patients with MCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, with baseline and 2-year follow-up scans obtained using F-18 florbetapir PET and MRI. Patients were categorized as converters (progressing to AD) or nonconverters based on a 6-year follow-up. Quantitative analyses included the calculation of amyloid burden using the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), brain amyloid smoothing scores (BASSs), brain atrophy indices (BAIs), and their integration into shape features. Longitudinal changes and receiver operating characteristic analyses assessed the predictive power of these biomarkers. Among 180 patients with MCI, 76 (42.2%) were converters, who exhibited significantly higher baseline and 2-year follow-up values for SUVR, BASS, BAI, and shape features than nonconverters ( The integration of amyloid PET and MRI biomarkers enhances the prediction of AD progression in patients with MCI. These findings support the potential of combined imaging approaches for early diagnosis and targeted interventions in AD.

Early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease through data fusion of MRI and DTI images using the YOLOv11 neural network.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide, affecting over 55 million people globally, with numbers expected to rise dramatically. Early detection and classification of AD are crucial for improving patient outcomes and slowing disease progression. However, conventional diagnostic approaches often fail to provide accurate classification in the early stages. This paper proposes a novel approach using advanced computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems and the YOLOv11 neural network for early detection and classification of AD. The YOLOv11 model leverages its advanced object detection capabilities to simultaneously localize and classify AD-related biomarkers by integrating multimodal data fusion of T2-weighted MRI and DTI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected and annotated based on known AD biomarkers, and the YOLOv11 model was trained to classify AD into four stages: Cognitively Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The model achieved exceptional performance, with 93.6% precision, 91.6% recall, and 96.7% mAP50, demonstrating its ability to identify subtle biomarkers by combining MRI and DTI modalities. This work highlights the novelty of using YOLOv11 for simultaneous detection and classification, offering a promising strategy for early-stage AD diagnosis and classification.

Temporal-multimodal consistency alignment for Alzheimer's cognitive assessment prediction.	As one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) severely impacts human thinking and behavior. Early and accurate prediction of cognitive decline is crucial for timely AD intervention. However, most existing prognostic methods hardly explore the underlying association among longitudinal data from different modalities in disease progression, thus the predictive ability of current models is still quite limited. We propose the unifying Multi-Modality fusion with DUal-gRanularity Alignment framework (MM-DURA) to simultaneously model longitudinal correlations and modalities interactions for cognitive assessment forecasting. Our proposed framework leverages temporal MRI scans, time-aligned clinical diagnostics, and genomic data as inputs to forecast multiple cognitive assessment scores. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine feature representation learning approach to ascertain the congruence between modalities at both the subject and visit granularities. This method ensures the alignment of multimodal data pertaining to individual subjects and captures the temporal progression of these modalities. Additionally, we design a hierarchical multimodality fusion (HMF) block that can effectively exploit the interrelationships and dependencies among modalities. Lastly, we employ an LSTM-based regression head with the fused multimodality embedding as input to forecast the future status of cognitive ability. We validate our method on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and investigate the optimal hierarchical structure for modality fusion. The whole dataset includes 707 subjects participating in the ADNI1, ADNIGO, and ADNI2 studies. All subjects underwent longitudinal examinations with an average study period of approximately 14 months. The subject-level split for training, validation, and testing sets is 0.75:0.05:0.20. The proposed MM-DURA framework demonstrates superior performance, achieving remarkable RMSE values of 1.099 for CDRSB, 5.601 for ADAS-Cog, 2.051 for MMSE, 6.504 for RAVLT, and 3.447 for FAQ cognitive assessments forecasting. These results outperform all six comparison methods, including two state-of-the-art multimodal temporal modeling approaches. Comprehensive ablation experimental results affirm the effectiveness of longitudinal modeling with temporal-multimodal alignment, highlighting its clinical potential for cognitive assessment prediction. Visualizations of key brain regions and SNP significance analysis also provide substantial interpretability. In this work, we proposed a novel framework that unifies multimodality fusion with dual-granularity alignment for cognitive assessment forecasting. Our approach utilizes a temporal-multimodal consistency alignment strategy, which effectively synchronizes various modalities within a unified latent space. Furthermore, the innovative HMF block we developed capitalizes on the inherent relationships and dependencies between modalities to optimize data integration. Extensive numerical results on five cognitive assessment scores, supported by detailed visualizations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing methods.

Linking genomic and proteomic signatures to brain amyloid burden: insights from GR@ACE/DEGESCO.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease with a strong genetic component, yet many genetic risk factors remain unknown. We combined genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on amyloid endophenotypes measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) as surrogates of amyloid pathology, which may provide insights into the underlying biology of the disease. We performed a meta-GWAS of CSF Aβ42 and PET measures combining six independent cohorts (n = 2,076). Given the opposite beta direction of Aβ phenotypes in CSF and PET measures, only genetic signals showing opposite directions were considered for analysis (n = 376,599). We explored the amyloidosis signature in the CSF proteome using SOMAscan proteomics (ACE cohort, n = 1,008), connected it with GWAS loci modulating amyloidosis and performed an enrichment analysis of overlapping hits. Finally, we compared our results with a large meta-analysis using publicly available datasets in CSF (n = 13,409) and PET (n = 13,116). After filtering the meta-GWAS, we observed genome-wide significance in the rs429358-APOE locus and annotated nine suggestive hits. We replicated the APOE loci using the large CSF-PET meta-GWAS, identifying multiple AD-associated genes including the novel GADL1 locus. Additionally, we found 1,387 FDR-significant SOMAscan proteins associated with CSF Aβ42 levels. The overlap among GWAS loci and proteins associated with amyloid burden was minimal (n = 35). The enrichment analysis revealed mechanisms connecting amyloidosis with the plasma membrane's anchored component, synapse physiology and mental disorders that were replicated in the large CSF-PET meta-analysis. Combining CSF and PET amyloid GWAS with CSF proteome analyses may effectively elucidate causative molecular mechanisms behind amyloid mobilization and AD physiopathology.

Blood DNA methylation signature for incident dementia: Evidence from longitudinal cohorts.	Distinguishing between molecular changes that precede dementia onset and those resulting from the disease is challenging with cross-sectional studies. We studied blood DNA methylation (DNAm) differences and incident dementia in two large longitudinal cohorts: the Offspring cohort of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We analyzed blood DNAm samples from > 1000 cognitively unimpaired subjects. Meta-analysis identified 44 CpGs and 44 differentially methylated regions consistently associated with time to dementia in both cohorts. Our integrative analysis identified early processes in dementia, such as immune responses and metabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, we developed a methylation-based risk score, which successfully predicted future cognitive decline in an independent validation set, even after accounting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4, years of education, baseline diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score. DNAm offers a promising source as a biomarker for dementia risk assessment. Blood DNA methylation (DNAm) differences at individual CpGs and differentially methylated regions are significantly associated with incident dementia. Pathway analysis revealed DNAm differences associated with incident dementia are significantly enriched in biological pathways involved in immune responses and metabolic processes. Out-of-sample validation analysis demonstrated that a methylation-based risk score successfully predicted future cognitive decline in an independent dataset, even after accounting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4, years of education, baseline diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score.

A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer Disease Clinical Trials.	Among the participants of Alzheimer disease (AD) treatment trials, 40% do not show cognitive decline over 80 weeks of follow-up. Identifying and excluding these individuals can increase power to detect treatment effects. We aimed to develop machine learning-based predictive models to identify persons unlikely to show decline on placebo treatment over 80 weeks. We used the data from the placebo arm of EXPEDITION3 AD clinical trial and a subpopulation from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants in the EXPEDITION3 trial were patients with mild dementia and biomarker evidence of amyloid burden. For this study, participants were identified as those who demonstrated clinically meaningful cognitive decline (CMCD) or cognitively stable (CS) at final visit of the trial (week 80). Machine learning-based classifiers were trained to classify participants into CMCD vs CS groups using combinations of demographics, APOE genotype, neuropsychological tests, and biomarkers (volumetric MRI). The results were developed in 70% of the EXPEDITION3 placebo sample using 5-fold cross-validation. Trained models were then used to classify the participants in an internal validation sample and an external matched sample ADNI Eight hundred ninety-four of the 1,072 participants in the placebo arm of the EXPEDITION3 trial had necessary follow-up data, who were on average aged 72.7 (±7.7) years and 59% female. 55.8% of those participants showed CMCD (∼2 years younger than those without) at the final visit. In the independent validation sample within the EXPEDITION3 data, all the models showed high sensitivity and modest specificity. Positive predictive values (PPVs) of models were at least 11% higher than base prevalence of CMCD observed at the end of the trial. The subset of matched ADNI participants (ADNI Our results indicate that predictive models have the potential to improve the design of AD trials through selective inclusion and exclusion criteria based on expected cognitive decline. Such predictive models need further validation across data from different AD clinical trials.

Determining the Role of Sex and APOE4 status on Psychosis in Alzheimer's Disease.	BackgroundPsychosis occurs in approximately 41% of patients living with Alzheimer's disease. Previous findings from our group based on analyses of a neuropathological cohort suggest that among AD patients with Lewy Body pathology, female APOE4 homozygotes are at significantly greater risk of psychosis. This study aims to replicate this finding in a clinical cohort using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.MethodsOur group used data from a sample of patients with AD in the ADNI database from the ADNI1, ADNI2, ADNI3, and ADNIGO studies. We defined psychosis status as experiencing hallucinations or delusions at one time point based on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. We then used forward binary logistic regression to determine if sex and APOE4 status are predictors of AD + P.ResultsIn total there were 204 participants who met the inclusion criteria, 133 of which were male, and 71 of which were female.

Influence of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and diagnostic factors on financial capacity: A longitudinal analysis of the ADNI cohort.	"Financial capacity (FC) is the ability to independently manage finances in a manner consistent with one's self-interest. To investigate the relationship between FC, cognitive domains, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and transitions from normal cognition (cognitive normal [CN]) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), we conducted a secondary analysis of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort using the Financial Capacity Instrument short form (FCI-SF). To examine these longitudinal relationships, we fit two models, a random effects (random intercept) ""time-averaged"" model and a ""time since previous visit"" model, where we regressed each of the five component financial scores on each of the cognitive composite scores. To examine the effect of baseline FCI-SF performance on conversion rates from normal to MCI or AD, we computed a survival model. A total of 874 participants (diagnostic group, There is a multifaceted interaction between poorer cognition and everyday financial function where executive function, memory, and visuospatial cognition are related to FC.

Potential of facial biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and obstructive sleep apnea in Down syndrome and general population.	Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy 21, is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Traditional diagnostic methods for AD and OSA, like cerebrospinal fluid analysis and polysomnography, are invasive and challenging for people with DS. In this study, we assessed whether facial morphology could be used as a potential noninvasive biomarker for these conditions in both DS and the general population. We performed a comprehensive 3D analysis of facial shape variation by registering the 3D coordinates of 21 landmarks on facial models extracted from magnetic resonance images of 131 individuals with DS and 216 euploid (EU) adult controls, including AD and OSA cases. Procrustes ANOVA and MANOVA quantified shape variation by sex, age, and facial size, while geometric morphometrics assessed diagnostic group differences. Significant facial shape differences were observed between the DS and EU groups, indicating sex-dependent differences and altered age-related changes in DS, particularly in females. Facial shape correlated with the amyloid beta ratio (Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40), a key AD biomarker. In DS, facial shape differences by AD diagnosis were not significant after adjusting for age and facial size, but significant shape differences were detected in the EU population. For OSA, facial shape correlated with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and DS individuals with severe OSA showed distinct facial morphology compared with those without OSA, suggesting an association between facial shape and sleep respiratory disturbances. These results highlight the potential of facial morphology as a noninvasive biomarker for AD and OSA detection and management.	dementia; facial development; facial dysmorphology; geometric morphometrics; ontogenetic trajectories; sexual dimorphism; sleep and respiratory disorders; trisomy 21

Parsimonious EBM: Generalising the event-based model of disease progression for simultaneous events.	"The event-based model of disease progression (EBM) infers a temporal ordering of biomarker abnormalities, defining different disease stages, from cross-sectional data. A key modelling choice of the EBM is that biomarker abnormalities, termed events, are serially ordered. However, this choice enforces a strict equality between the number of input biomarkers and the number of modelled disease stages, limiting the EBM's ability to infer simple staging systems and identify latent disease processes driving multiple biomarker changes. To overcome this, we introduce the parsimonious event-based model of disease progression (P-EBM). The P-EBM generalises the EBM to allow multiple new biomarker abnormalities, termed ""simultaneous events"", at each model stage. We evaluate the P-EBM performance in simulated data and demonstrate its ability to reconstruct event orderings with arbitrary arrangements under realistic experimental conditions. In sporadic AD data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the P-EBM estimated a sequence with 7 model stages from a dataset of 12 biomarkers that more closely fitted the data than the EBM.

Accurate staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is crucial for therapeutic trials and prognosis, but existing fluid biomarkers lack specificity, especially for assessing tau deposition severity, in amyloid-beta (Aβ)-positive patients. We analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 136 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using more than 6,000 proteins. We apply machine learning to predict AD pathological stages defined by amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET). We identify two distinct protein panels: 16 proteins, including neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), that distinguished Aβ-negative/tau-negative (A-T-) from A+ individuals and nine proteins, such as HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), that differentiated A+T+ from A+T- stages. These signatures outperform the established CSF biomarkers (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.92 versus 0.67-0.70) and accurately predicted disease progression over a decade. The findings are validated in both internal and external cohorts. These results underscore the potential of proteomic-based signatures to refine AD diagnostic criteria and improve patient stratification in clinical trials.

Machine-learning models for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using neuroimaging data: survey, reproducibility, and generalizability evaluation.	Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually made after symptoms such as short-term memory loss are exhibited, which minimizes the intervention and treatment options. The existing screening techniques cannot distinguish between stable MCI (sMCI) cases (i.e., patients who do not convert to AD for at least three years) and progressive MCI (pMCI) cases (i.e., patients who convert to AD in three years or sooner). Delayed diagnosis of AD also disproportionately affects underrepresented and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. The significant positive impact of an early diagnosis solution for AD across diverse ethno-racial and demographic groups is well-known and recognized. While advancements in high-throughput technologies have enabled the generation of vast amounts of multimodal clinical, and neuroimaging datasets related to AD, most methods utilizing these data sets for diagnostic purposes have not found their way in clinical settings. To better understand the landscape, we surveyed the major preprocessing, data management, traditional machine-learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) techniques used for diagnosing AD using neuroimaging data such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Once we had a good understanding of the methods available, we conducted a study to assess the reproducibility and generalizability of open-source ML models. Our evaluation shows that existing models show reduced generalizability when different cohorts of the data modality are used while controlling other computational factors. The paper concludes with a discussion of major challenges that plague ML models for AD diagnosis and biomarker discovery.

Glymphatic function decline as a mediator of core memory-related brain structures atrophy in aging.	This study aimed to elucidate the role of the glymphatic system-a crucial pathway for clearing waste in the brain-in the aging process and its contribution to cognitive decline. We specifically focused on the diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index as a noninvasive biomarker of glymphatic function. Data were drawn from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and a separate validation cohort to analyze the ALPS index in cognitively normal older adults. The relationships among the ALPS index, brain morphometry, and memory performance were examined. As a biomarker of glymphatic function, the ALPS index appeared to decline with age in both cohorts. According to the brain morphology analysis, the ALPS index was positively correlated with the thickness of the left entorhinal cortex ( This study highlights the ALPS index as a promising biomarker for glymphatic function and links it to atrophy of the core memory brain regions during aging. Furthermore, these results suggest that targeting glymphatic dysfunction could represent a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate age-related memory decline.	aging; cognitive function; entorhinal cortex; glymphatic system; memory

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a significant risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Here, we identified a T2DM-specific effective connectivity (EC) network, the dynamic features of which could be used to distinguish T2DM patients with MCI from healthy controls (HC) and correlation with cognitive performance. Local and multicentered T2DM patients and matched HC who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging were recruited. Their static and dynamic effective connectivity were compared. The relationships between connectome characteristics and cognitive performance were also evaluated. The nodes of the T2DM-related static causality network included the anterior central gyrus, tail of the parahippocampal gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus, posterior central parietal lobe, posterior central gyrus and V5 region of the occipital lobe. The V5 region of the visual cortex was the core node. In the multicentered dataset, compared with the HC group, the T2DM with MCI group had significantly greater fractional window and mean dwell time. Fractional windows of the state, which was dominated by the interaction of the nodes from SomMot_Network, Limbic_Network, Default_Network, in the T2DM-specific network increased with poorer cognitive performance in T2DM with MCI patients. Our findings provide insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of the cognitive impairment of T2DM patients from a dynamic network perspective, which may ultimately inform more targeted and effective strategies to prevent MCI.

Elevated CSF GAP-43 in Mild Cognitive Impairment Linked to Cognitive Impairment Through Increased Amyloid-β Accumulation, with a Shift to Reduced Amyloid-β Accumulation in Alzheimer's Disease.	Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), a key regulator of synaptic plasticity, neuronal growth, and memory, has recently been identified as a crucial biomarker for synaptic dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying GAP-43's role in cognitive impairment by examining the relationship between CSF GAP-43 levels and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in brain regions like the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. This study included 332 participants sourced from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), categorized into three groups: 93 cognitively normal (CN), 218 with MCI, and 21 with AD dementia. Cognitive status was assessed with ADAS-Cog 13, CSF GAP-43 levels via ELISA, and Aβ accumulation using florbetapir PET imaging and Syngo.PET for SUVr values in key brain regions. The results revealed that CSF GAP-43 levels were highest in the AD dementia group, followed by the MCI group, and lowest in the CN group, with a significant difference (p < 0.001), indicating a link between elevated CSF GAP-43 and cognitive impairment. In MCI group, CSF GAP-43 positively correlated with Aβ accumulation in all regions: Globally (β = 0.362, p < 0.001), frontal (β = 0.388, p < 0.001), temporal (β = 0.382, p < 0.001), and parietal lobes (β = 0.344, p < 0.001). In contrast, the AD dementia group exhibited negative correlations between CSF GAP-43 levels and Aβ accumulation, significantly in the frontal (β = - 0.513, p = 0.035) and parietal lobes (β = - 0.513, p = 0.035), suggesting a shift in the CSF GAP-43-Aβ relationship in AD dementia. Mediation analysis, adjusted for age, gender, education, and ApoE ɛ4 status, revealed that elevated CSF GAP-43 is linked to increased cognitive impairment via increasing Aβ accumulation solely in MCI, with significant effects in global (β = 0.0894, CI: [0.0427, 0.1457]), frontal (β = 0.0895, CI: [0.0422, 0.1443]), temporal (β = 0.0941, CI: [0.0466, 0.1522]), and parietal (β = 0.0499, CI: [0.0100, 0.0945]) regions. Thus, elevated CSF GAP-43 may contribute to cognitive impairment by promoting Aβ accumulation in individuals with MCI, while in AD dementia, it may be associated with reduced Aβ accumulation, potentially reflecting a compensatory or disease-stage-dependent effect. This dynamic relationship suggests that GAP-43 could play a dual role in neurodegeneration, influencing Aβ pathology differently across disease stages.

Association of neighborhood disadvantage with cognitive function and cortical disorganization in an unimpaired cohort: An exploratory study.	Neighborhood disadvantage has been shown to impact health and cognitive outcomes, while morphological similarity network (MSN) can elucidate structural morphological patterns underlying cognitive functions. We hypothesized MSNs could provide cortical patterns linked with neighborhood disadvantage and cognitive function, explaining the potential risk of cognitive impairment in disadvantaged neighborhoods. For cognitively unimpaired participants from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center or Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (n = 524), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (n = 100), neighborhood disadvantage was obtained using Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and its association with cognitive performance and MSN features was analyzed using linear regression and mediation analysis. Neighborhood disadvantage was associated with worse cognitive performance on memory, executive function, processing speed, and preclinical Alzheimer's tests on both datasets. Local morphological organization of predominantly the frontal and temporal regions showed association trends with ADI. Morphological patterns associated with ADI, in-part, may explain the risk for poor cognitive functioning in a neighborhood disadvantaged population. Social determinants of health such as neighborhood context can be studied using ADI. High neighborhood disadvantage was related to worse performance on category fluency, implicit learning speed, story recall memory and pre-clinical Alzheimer's cognitive composite. In this exploratory study, using morphological brain networks that indicate similarity in distribution of cortical thickness between regions, we observed that centrality of predominantly frontal and temporal regions was marginally linked with neighborhood disadvantage status and also partially mediated its association with preclinical Alzheimer's composite test. There is a potential role for considering neighborhood status in early screening of cognitive impairment and dementia.

Predicting amyloid beta accumulation in cognitively unimpaired older adults: Cognitive assessments provide no additional utility beyond demographic and genetic factors.	Integrating non-invasive measures to estimate abnormal amyloid beta accumulation (Aβ+) is key to developing a screening tool for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). The predictive capability of standard neuropsychological tests in estimating Aβ+ has not been quantified. We constructed machine learning models using six cognitive measurements alongside demographic and genetic risk factors to predict Aβ status. Data were drawn from three cohorts: Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle (AIBL) study. Internal validation was conducted within A4 with external validations in ADNI and AIBL to assess model generalizability. The highest area under the curve (AUC) for predicting Aβ+ was observed with demographic, genetic, and cognitive variables in A4 (median AUC = 0.745), but this was not significantly different from models without cognitive variables. External validation showed no improvement in ADNI and a slight decrease in AIBL. Standard neuropsychological tests do not significantly enhance Aβ+ prediction in cognitively unimpaired adults beyond demographic and genetic information. Standard neuropsychological tests do not significantly improve the prediction of amyloid beta positivity (Aβ+) in cognitively unimpaired older adults beyond demographic and genetic information alone. Across three well-characterized cohorts, machine learning models incorporating cognitive measures failed to significantly improve Aβ+ prediction, indicating the limited relationship between cognitive performance on these tests and the risk of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings challenge assumptions about cognitive symptoms preceding Aβ+ screening and emphasize the need for developing more sensitive cognitive tests for early AD detection.	machine learning; neuropsychological tests; preclinical Alzheimer's disease

Towards Clinical Diagnoses: Classifying Alzheimer's Disease Using Single fMRI, Small Datasets, and Transfer Learning.	Deep learning and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are two unique methodologies that can be combined to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple studies have harnessed these methods to diagnose AD with high accuracy. However, there are difficulties in adapting this research to real-world diagnoses. For example, the two key issues of data availability and model usability limit clinical applications. These two areas are concerned with problems of accessibility, generalizability, and methodology that may limit model adoption. For example, fMRI deep learning models require a large amount of training data, which is not widely available. Contemporary models are also not typically formatted for clinical data or created for use by non-specialized populations. In this study, we develop a deep-learning fMRI pipeline that addresses some of these issues. We use transfer learning to address problems with data availability. We also use semi-automated and single-image techniques (i.e., one fMRI volume per participant) to make a model that is usable for non-specialized populations. Our model was initially trained on 524 participants from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE; Autism and controls). Our model was then transferred and fine-tuned to a small sample of 64 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; AD and controls). This transfer learning model achieved an AD classification accuracy of 77% and outperformed the same model without transfer learning by approximately 30%. Accordingly, our model showed that small AD samples can be accurately classified in a clinically friendly manner.

Comorbid cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors (CVM) differentially impact brain structure and increase dementia risk, but their specific magnetic resonance imaging signatures (MRI) remain poorly characterized. To address this, we developed and validated machine learning models to quantify the distinct spatial patterns of atrophy and white matter hyperintensities related to hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, and type-2 diabetes mellitus at the patient level. Using harmonized MRI data from 37,096 participants (45-85 years) in a large multinational dataset of 10 cohort studies, we generated five in silico severity markers that: i) outperformed conventional structural MRI markers with a ten-fold increase in effect sizes, ii) captured subtle patterns at sub-clinical CVM stages, iii) were most sensitive in mid-life (45-64 years), iv) were associated with brain beta-amyloid status, and v) showed stronger associations with cognitive performance than diagnostic CVM status. Integrating personalized measurements of CVM-specific brain signatures into phenotypic frameworks could guide early risk detection and stratification in clinical studies.

Understanding the complex interplay between tau, amyloid and the network in the spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's Disease.	"The interaction of amyloid and tau in neurodegenerative diseases is a central feature of AD pathophysiology. While experimental studies point to various interaction mechanisms, their causal direction and mode (local, remote or network-mediated) remain unknown in human subjects. The aim of this study was to compare mathematical reaction-diffusion models encoding distinct cross-species couplings to identify which interactions were key to model success. We tested competing mathematical models of network spread, aggregation, and amyloid-tau interactions on publicly available data from ADNI. Although network spread models captured the spatiotemporal evolution of tau and amyloid in human subjects, the model including a one-way amyloid-to-tau aggregation interaction performed best.

Connectivity related to major brain functions in Alzheimer disease progression: microstructural properties of the cingulum bundle and its subdivision using diffusion-weighted MRI.	"The cingulum bundle is a brain white matter fasciculus associated with the cingulate gyrus. It connects areas from the temporal to the frontal lobe. It is composed of fibers with different terminations, lengths, and structural properties, related to specific brain functions. We aimed to automatically reconstruct this fasciculus in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to assess whether trajectories have different microstructural properties in relation to dementia progression. Multi-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging-HARDI image datasets from the ""Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative""-ADNI repository of 10 AD, 18 MCI, and 21 cognitive normal (CN) subjects were used to reconstruct three subdivisions of the cingulum bundle, using a probabilistic approach, combined with measurements of diffusion tensor and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging metrics in each subdivision. The subdivisions exhibit different pathways, terminations, and structural characteristics. We found differences in almost all the diffusivity metrics among the subdivisions (p < 0.001 for all the metrics) and between AD versus CN and MCI versus CN subjects for mean diffusivity (p = 0.007-0.038), radial diffusivity (p = 0.008-0.049) and neurite dispersion index (p = 0.005-0.049). Results from tractography analysis of the subdivisions of the cingulum bundle showed an association in the role of groups of fibers with their functions and the variance of their properties in relation to dementia progression. The cingulum bundle is a complex tract with several pathways and terminations related to many cognitive functions. A probabilistic automatic approach is proposed to reconstruct its subdivisions, showing different microstructural properties and variations. A larger sample of patients is needed to confirm results and elucidate the role of diffusion parameters in characterizing alterations in brain function and progression to dementia. The microstructure of the cingulum bundle is related to brain cognitive functions. A probabilistic automatic approach is proposed to reconstruct the subdivisions of the cingulum bundle by diffusion-weighted images. The subdivisions showed different microstructural properties and variations in relation to the progression of dementia."

Interactive effects of post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity and hypertension on cognitive dispersion in older Vietnam-Era veterans with history of post-traumatic stress disorder.	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and hypertension are highly prevalent among Veterans. Cognitive dispersion, indicating within-person variability across neuropsychological measures at one time point, is associated with increased risk of dementia. We examined interactive effects of PTSD symptom severity and hypertension on cognitive dispersion among older Veterans. We included 128 Vietnam-era Veterans from the Department of Defense-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (DoD-ADNI) with a history of PTSD. Regression models examined interactions between PTSD symptom severity and hypertension on cognitive dispersion (defined as the intraindividual standard deviation across eight cognitive measures) adjusting for demographics and comorbid vascular risk factors. There was an interaction between PTSD symptom severity and hypertension on cognitive dispersion ( Findings suggest, among older Veterans with PTSD, those with both hypertension and more severe PTSD symptoms may be at greater risk for cognitive difficulties. Further, cognitive dispersion may be a useful marker of subtle cognitive difficulties. Future research should examine these associations longitudinally and in a diverse sample.

Perivascular space and white matter hyperintensities in Alzheimer's disease: associations with disease progression and cognitive function.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles. Recent studies emphasize the role of vascular factors, including the glymphatic system, in AD pathogenesis, particularly in Aβ clearance. The diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS; ALPS-Index) has emerged as a novel, non-invasive method to evaluate the glymphatic system in vivo, showing glymphatic insufficiency in AD. This study aimed to investigate alterations in the function of the glymphatic system in individuals with AD versus healthy controls (HC), and to explore its association with Aβ, cerebrovascular disease (CVD), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and cognitive function. DTI MRI data from three independent study cohorts (ActiGliA: AD n = 16, Controls n = 18; DELCODE: AD n = 54, Controls n = 67; ADNI: AD n = 43, Controls n = 49) were used to evaluate the perivascular space (PVS) integrity; a potential biomarker for glymphatic activity. The DTI-Along the Perivascular Space technique was used to measure water diffusion along PVS providing an index to assess the efficiency of the glymphatic system's waste clearance function. WMH load was quantified in FLAIR MRI using the lesion segmentation tool. We quantified WMHs volume within our defined region of interest (ROI) and excluded participants with any WMHs to avoid confounding the ALPS-Index. Associations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD hallmark biomarkers, cognitive performance (MMSE) and clinical severity (CDR) were assessed. AD patients had a significantly lower ALPS-Index vs. healthy controls (ActiGliA: AD: mean = 1.22, SD = 0.12; Controls: mean = 1.36, SD = 0.14, p = 0.004; DELCODE: AD: mean = 1.26, SD = 0.18; Controls: mean = 1.34, SD = 0.2, p = 0.035; ADNI: AD: mean = 1.08, SD = 0.24; Controls: mean = 1.19, SD = 0.13, p = 0.008). The ALPS-Index was associated with CSF Aβ concentration, WMH number and MMSE and CDR. WMH, found in the ROIs correlated negatively with the ALPS-Index. This study highlights the potential of the DTI-ALPS-Index as a biomarker for glymphatic dysfunction in AD. It underscores the importance of considering vascular factors and the glymphatic system in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of AD as WMHs in the ROI could cause disturbances and inaccurate indices.

Alpha synuclein co-pathology is associated with accelerated amyloid-driven tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.	Aggregated alpha-Synuclein (αSyn) is a hallmark pathology in Parkinson's disease but also one of the most common co-pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preclinical studies suggest that αSyn can exacerbate tau aggregation, implying that αSyn co-pathology may specifically contribute to the Aβ-induced aggregation of tau that drives neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD. To investigate this, we combined a novel CSF-based seed-amplification assay (SAA) to determine αSyn positivity with amyloid- and tau-PET neuroimaging in a large cohort ranging from cognitively normal individuals to those with dementia, examining whether αSyn co-pathology accelerates Aβ-driven tau accumulation and cognitive decline. In 284 Aβ-positive and 308 Aβ-negative subjects, we employed amyloid-PET, Flortaucipir tau-PET, and a CSF-based αSyn seed-amplification assay (SAA) to detect in vivo αSyn aggregation. CSF p-tau αSyn SAA positivity was more common in Aβ + vs. Aβ- subjects and increased with clinical severity (p < 0.001). Most importantly, αSyn positivity was also associated with greater amyloid-associated CSF p-tau Our findings suggest that αSyn co-pathology, detectable via CSF-based SAAs, is more prevalent in advanced AD and contributes to the development of aggregated tau pathology thereby driving faster cognitive decline. This highlights that a-Syn co-pathology may specifically accelerate amyloid-driven tau pathophysiology in AD, underscoring the need to consider αSyn in AD research and treatment strategies.

Cerebrospinal fluid VGF is associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease.	BackgroundIt remains unclear whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VGF (non-acronymic) is associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD).ObjectiveTo assess the levels of CSF VGF throughout the AD continuum, and its association with primary AD pathology, cognition, brain atrophy, and brain metabolism.MethodsWe studied a total of 526 individuals including 377 amyloid-positive individuals (76 preclinical AD, 200 prodromal AD, and 101 AD dementia) and 149 amyloid-negative cognitively normal individuals. VGF peptide in CSF was analyzed using mass spectrometry.ResultsWe observed decreased CSF VGF in preclinical, prodromal, and AD dementia individuals than amyloid-negative cognitively normal individuals. Reduced CSF VGF was associated with cognitive decline, hippocampal atrophy, ventricle enlargement, and glucose hypometabolism at baseline, and it predicted a more marked deterioration over time.ConclusionsOur findings support the important contributions of VGF to disease pathogenesis and progression in the early stages of AD. Exploring the biologics modulating VGF might be a promising approach for AD prevention and early treatment.

AgeNet-SHAP: An explainable AI approach for optimally mapping multivariate regional brain age and clinical severity patterns in Alzheimer's disease.	Age is a significant risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identifying brain age patterns is critical for comprehending the normal aging and MCI/AD processes. Prior studies have widely established the univariate relationships between brain regions and age, while multivariate associations remain largely unexplored. Herein, various artificial intelligence (AI) models were employed to perform brain age prediction using an MRI dataset (n=668). Then the optimal AI model was integrated with the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) feature importance technique to identify the significant multivariate brain regions involved in this prediction. Our results indicated that the deep learning model (referred to as AgeNet) tremendously outperformed the conventional machine learning models for brain age prediction, and AgeNet integrated with SHAP (referred to as AgeNet-SHAP) identified all ground-truth perturbed regions as key predictors of brain age in semi-simulation, proved the validity of our methodology. In the experimental dataset, compared to cognitively normal (CN) participants, MCI exhibited moderate differences in brain regions, whereas AD had highly robust and widely distributed regional differences. The individualized AgeNet-SHAP regional features further showed associations with clinical severity scores in the AD continuum. These results collectively facilitate data-driven predictive modelling approaches for disease progression, diagnostics, prognostics, and personalized medicine efforts.

Uncovering atrophy progression pattern and mechanisms in individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease is associated with pre-symptomatic changes in brain morphometry and accumulation of abnormal tau and amyloid-beta pathology. Studying the development of brain changes prior to symptoms onset may lead to early diagnostic biomarkers and a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Alzheimer's disease pathology is thought to arise from a combination of protein accumulation and spreading via neural connections, but how these processes influence brain atrophy progression in the pre-symptomatic phases remains unclear. Individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (FHAD) have an elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease, providing an opportunity to study the pre-symptomatic phase. Here, we used structural MRI from three databases (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for Alzheimer Disease and Montreal Adult Lifespan Study) to map atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease and assess the constraining effects of structural connectivity on atrophy progression. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data up to 4 years were used to perform atrophy progression analysis in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. PET radiotracers were also used to quantify the distribution of abnormal tau and amyloid-beta protein isoforms at baseline. We first derived cortical atrophy progression maps using deformation-based morphometry from 153 FHAD, 156 Alzheimer's disease and 116 controls with similar age, education and sex at baseline. We next examined the spatial relationship between atrophy progression and spatial patterns of tau aggregates and amyloid-beta plaques deposition, structural connectivity and neurotransmitter receptor and transporter distributions. Our results show that there were similar patterns of atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease, notably in the cingulate, temporal and parietal cortices, with more widespread and severe atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. Both tau and amyloid-beta pathology tended to accumulate in regions that were structurally connected in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease. The pattern of atrophy and its progression also aligned with existing structural connectivity in FHAD. In Alzheimer's disease, our findings suggest that atrophy progression results from pathology propagation that occurred earlier, on a previously intact connectome. Moreover, a relationship was found between serotonin receptor spatial distribution and atrophy progression in Alzheimer's disease. The current study demonstrates that regions showing atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease present with specific connectivity and cellular characteristics, uncovering some of the mechanisms involved in pre-clinical and clinical neurodegeneration.

Amyloid PET in Sporadic Early- Versus Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: Comparison of the LEADS and ADNI Cohorts.	Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) differ in many respects. Here, we address the issue of possible differences in fibrillar amyloid pathology as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), which remains unresolved due to the lack of large-scale comparative studies. Three hundred ninety-nine cognitively impaired participants younger than 65 years of age from the multicenter Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) and 450 cognitively impaired participants older than 65 years from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent clinical assessment, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and amyloid PET and were included in this study. We compared amyloid PET outcomes (positivity rate based on visual read and quantified tracer uptake expressed as Centiloids [CLs]) between the 2 cohorts and studied their association with age, sex, APOE genotype, and cognition. The amyloid positivity rate was higher in LEADS (78%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74-82) than in ADNI (71%, 95% CI = 67-75, p = 0.02). Lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and APOE4 genotype increased the odds of amyloid positivity in both cohorts. Visually positive scans had higher CLs in LEADS (EOAD, mean = 95.3 ± 26.1) than in ADNI (LOAD, mean = 80.9 ± 36.8, p < 0.0001), predominantly in parietal cortex/precuneus, superior temporal, and frontal cortices. In amyloid-positive patients, (1) CLs were higher in female patients in both cohorts; (2) APOE4 carriership was associated with lower CLs in EOAD, which was not observed in LOAD; and (3) correlations between CLs and MMSE scores were significantly stronger in EOAD than in LOAD. Differences in the burden of amyloid pathology may contribute to differences in clinical and anatomic patterns in sporadic EOAD and LOAD, and have implications for optimizing therapeutic strategies in each group.

The associations of cerebrospinal fluid ApoE and C1q with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.	BackgroundThe roles of complement 1q (C1q) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in driving Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression might be explained by their associations with neuroinflammation and AD pathology which were previously reported.ObjectiveWe examined the associations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) C1q and ApoE with CSF neuroinflammatory biomarkers and AD core biomarkers, as well as explored whether C1q mediated the associations of CSF ApoE with these biomarkers.MethodsHere, we analyzed CSF proteomics data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using two different ADNI proteomics datasets-SomaScan (n = 579)and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM[n = 207]). Linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the association of CSF ApoE and C1q. The mediation model and structural equation model (SEM) were conducted to explore the associations of ApoE and C1q with AD biomarkers.ResultsMultiple linear regression showed that CSF ApoE was positively associated with CSF C1q in total participants and Alzheimer's continuum participants. Mediation analyses indicated that C1q mediated the associations of CSF ApoE with CSF T-tau, P-tau, sTREM2 and GFAP (mediation proportions range from 15.06 to 44.64%; all the p values < 0.05) but not with CSF amyloid-β and progranulin (PGRN). The SEM yielded similar results.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that C1q is linked to ApoE, and it mediates the associations of ApoE with T-tau, P-tau, sTREM2, GFAP, indicating C1q association with ApoE might be involved in AD progression.

Changes in β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (T) in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) precede Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms, making the CSF proteome a potential avenue to understand disease pathophysiology and facilitate reliable diagnostics and therapies. Using the AT framework and a three-stage study design (discovery, replication, and meta-analysis), we identified 2,173 analytes (2,029 unique proteins) dysregulated in AD. Of these, 865 (43%) were previously reported, and 1,164 (57%) are novel. The identified proteins cluster in four different pseudo-trajectories groups spanning the AD continuum and were enriched in pathways including neuronal death, apoptosis, and tau phosphorylation (early stages), microglia dysregulation and endolysosomal dysfunction (mid stages), brain plasticity and longevity (mid stages), and microglia-neuron crosstalk (late stages). Using machine learning, we created and validated highly accurate and replicable (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.90) models that predict AD biomarker positivity and clinical status. These models can also identify people that will convert to AD.	ATN; Alzheimer disease; CSF; SomaScan; biomarkers; dementia progression; machine learning; proteomics; pseudo-trajectory
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative	ADNI		Ding Rizhi; Lu Hui; Liu Manhua		DenseFormer-MoE: A Dense Transformer Foundation Model with Mixture of Experts for Multi-Task Brain Image Analysis.	Deep learning models have been widely investigated for computing and analyzing brain images across various downstream tasks such as disease diagnosis and age regression. Most existing models are tailored for specific tasks and diseases, posing a challenge in developing a foundation model for diverse tasks. This paper proposes a Dense Transformer Foundation Model with Mixture of Experts (DenseFormer-MoE), which integrates dense convolutional network, Vision Transformer and Mixture of Experts (MoE) to progressively learn and consolidate local and global features from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (sMRI) for multiple tasks including diagnosing multiple brain diseases and predicting brain age. First, a foundation model is built by combining the vision Transformer with Densenet, which are pre-trained with Masked Autoencoder and self-supervised learning to enhance the generalization of feature representations. Then, to mitigate optimization conflicts in multi-task learning, MoE is designed to dynamically select the most appropriate experts for each task. Finally, our method is evaluated on multiple renowned brain imaging datasets including UK Biobank (UKB), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Experimental results and comparison demonstrate that our method achieves promising performances for prediction of brain age and diagnosis of brain diseases.

Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative	ADNI		Nabizadeh Fardin		Connectomics and neurotransmitter receptor profile explain regional tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease tau pathology spreads through neuronal pathways and synaptic connections. Alteration in synaptic activity facilitates tau spreading. Multiple neurotransmitter systems are shown to be implicated in Alzheimer's disease, but their influence on the trans-synaptic spread of tau is not well understood. I aimed to combine resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomics, neurotransmitter receptor profiles, and tau-PET data to explain the regional susceptibility to tau accumulation. The tau-PET imaging data of 161 amyloid-beta-negative cognitively unimpaired participants as control and 259 amyloid-beta-positive subjects were recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Linear regression analysis revealed that a higher tau-PET z-score is associated with a lower density of nine receptors in the serotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine, and glutamate systems. Furthermore, adding four neurotransmitter receptor density z-scores significantly increased the proportion of explained variance by 3% to 7% compared to the epicenter-connectivity distance model in the group-level analysis. Also, adding nine neurotransmitter receptor density z-scores to the epicenter-connectivity distance model increased the explanatory power of variability in individual levels of tau-PET z-score by 3% to 8%. The current study demonstrated the additive value of atlas-based neurotransmitter receptor mapping and individual-level amyloid-beta-PET scans to enhance the connectivity-based explanation of tau accumulation.

A novel method for harmonization of PET image spatial resolution without phantoms.	Estimation of the spatial resolution in real images is extremely important in several fields, including crystallography, optics, microscopy, and tomography. In human PET imaging, estimating spatial resolution typically involves the acquisition of images from a physical phantom, typically a Hoffman phantom, which poses a logistical burden, especially in large multi-center studies. Indeed, phantom images may not always be readily available, and this method requires constant monitoring of scanner updates or replacements, scanning protocol changes, and image reconstruction guidelines to establish a equivalence with scans acquired from human subjects. We propose a new computational approach that allows estimation of spatial resolution directly from human subject PET images. The proposed technique is based on the generalization of the logarithmic intensity plots in the 2D Fourier domain to the 3D case. The spatial resolution of the image is obtained through the estimated coefficients of a multiple linear regression problem having the logarithm of the squared norm of the Fourier transform as dependent variable and the squared 3D frequencies as multiple predictors. The proposed approach was applied to a cohort of subjects consisting of [18F]florbetapir amyloid PET images and matching phantoms from a Phase II clinical trial, and a second cohort including β-amyloid, FDG, and tau PET images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. The resulting in-plane and axial resolution estimators varied between 3.5 mm and 8.5 mm for both PET and matching phantom images. They also yielded less than one voxel size across-subjects variability in groups of images sharing the same PET scanner model and reconstruction parameters. For human PET images, we also proved that the spatial resolution estimators showed: (1) a very high reproducibility, as measured by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC > 0.985), (2) a strong cross-tracer linear correlations, and (3) a high within-subject longitudinal consistency, as measured by the maximum difference value between pairs of visits from the same subject. Our novel approach does not only eliminate the need for surrogate phantom data, but also provides a general framework that can be applied to a wide range of tracers and other imaging modalities, such as SPECT.

Diffusion-tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index that has the potential to reflect brain interstitial fluid (ISF) dynamics may predict the development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We aimed to study whether brain ISF dynamics indicated by the ALPS index relate to AD dementia diagnosis and AD-related changes. This study included a discovery cohort (n = 180) and a validation cohort (n = 127), which were composed of cognitively normal, subjective memory concern, mild cognitive impairment, and AD dementia subjects. All participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging examination and neuropsychological evaluation. The diffusivities and diffusion-tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) were calculated. The support vector machine (SVM) model for AD dementia diagnosis was built in the discovery cohort and validated in the validation cohort. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the association between the ALPS and cognitive decline. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association between the ALPS and the risk of AD dementia. There was a lower median ALPS index in the AD dementia group compared to other groups (all P < 0.05) for both cohorts. The SVM model for AD dementia diagnosis produced an AUC of 0.802 in the discovery cohort (P < 0.001) and 0.783 in the external validation cohort (P < 0.001). Higher ALPS levels were associated with less cognitive decline (P < 0.001). Moreover, lower baseline ALPS had a greater risk of converting to AD dementia (P = 0.014). The SVM model based on diffusivities and ALPS was effective for AD dementia diagnosis, and higher ALPS levels are associated with a lower risk of AD-related changes. These findings suggest that ALPS may provide a useful AD progression or treatment biomarker.	Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive decline; Diffusion tensor parameter; Glymphatic function

Functional dynamic network connectivity differentiates biological patterns in the Alzheimer's disease continuum.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be conceptualized as a network-based syndrome. Network alterations are linked to the molecular hallmarks of AD, involving amyloid-beta and tau accumulation, and consecutively neurodegeneration. By combining molecular and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed whether different biological patterns of AD identified through a data-driven approach matched specific abnormalities in brain dynamic connectivity. We identified three main patient clusters. The first group displayed mild pathological alterations. The second cluster exhibited typical behavioral impairment alongside AD pathology. The third cluster demonstrated similar behavioral impairment but with a divergent tau (low) and neurodegeneration (high) profile. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed two connectivity patterns encompassing the default mode network and the occipito-temporal cortex, linked respectively with typical and atypical patterns. These results support the key association between macro-scale and molecular alterations. Dynamic connectivity markers can assist in identifying patients with AD-like clinical profiles but with different underlying pathologies.	Brain networks; Dynamic connectivity; Molecular pathology

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its progression involves complex pathogenic mechanisms. Specifically, disturbed by gene variants, the regulation of gene expression ultimately changes brain structure, resulting in the progression of brain diseases. However, the existing works rarely take these mechanisms into account when designing their diagnosis methods. Therefore, we propose a novel gradual multi-modal fusion framework to fuse representative data from each stage of disease progression in hybrid feature space, including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), gene expression (GE), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specifically, to integrate genetic sequence and expression data, we design a SNP-GE fusion module, which performs multi-modal fusion to obtain genetic embedding by considering the relation between SNP and GE. Compared with SNP-GE fusion, representation of genetic embedding and MRI have more obvious heterogeneity, especially correlation with disease. Therefore, we propose to align the manifold of genetic and imaging representations, which can explore the high-order relationship between imaging and genetic data in the presence of modal heterogeneity. Our proposed framework was validated using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, and achieved diagnosis accuracy of 76.88%, 72.84%, 87.72%, and 95.00% for distinguishing MCI from control normal, lately MCI from early MCI, MCI from AD, and AD from control normal, respectively. Additionally, our proposed framework helps to identify some multi-modal biomarkers related to MCI progression. In summary, our proposed framework is effective not only for MCI diagnosis but also for guiding the further development of genetic and imaging-based brain studies.

MCNEL: A multi-scale convolutional network and ensemble learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) significantly threatens community well-being and healthcare resource allocation due to its high incidence and mortality. Therefore, early detection and intervention are crucial for reducing AD-related fatalities. However, the existing deep learning-based approaches often struggle to capture complex structural features of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data effectively. Common techniques for multi-scale feature fusion, such as direct summation and concatenation methods, often introduce redundant noise that can negatively affect model performance. These challenges highlight the need for developing more advanced methods to improve feature extraction and fusion, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study proposes a multi-scale convolutional network and ensemble learning (MCNEL) framework for early and accurate AD diagnosis. The framework adopts enhanced versions of the EfficientNet-B0 and MobileNetV2 models, which are subsequently integrated with the DenseNet121 model to create a hybrid feature extraction tool capable of extracting features from multi-view slices. Additionally, a SimAM-based feature fusion method is developed to synthesize key feature information derived from multi-scale images. To ensure classification accuracy in distinguishing AD from multiple stages of cognitive impairment, this study designs an ensemble learning classifier model using multiple classifiers and a self-adaptive weight adjustment strategy. Extensive experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset validate the effectiveness of our solution, which achieves average accuracies of 96.67% for ADNI-1 and 96.20% for ADNI-2, respectively. The results indicate that the MCNEL outperforms recent comparable algorithms in terms of various evaluation metrics, demonstrating superior performance and robustness in AD diagnosis. This study markedly enhances the diagnostic capabilities for AD, allowing patients to receive timely treatments that can slow down disease progression and improve their quality of life.

Big databases and biobanks for studying the links between CKD, cognitive impairment, and dementia.	Research on cognitive function in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is critical due to the significant public health challenge posed by both CKD and cognitive impairment. CKD affects approximately 10-15% of the adult population, with higher prevalence in the elderly, who are already at increased risk for cognitive decline. Cognitive impairment is notably higher in CKD patients, particularly those with severe stages of the disease, and progresses more rapidly in those on dialysis. This review explores how data from large biobank studies such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, UK Biobank, and others could be used to enhance understanding the progression and interplay between CKD and cognitive decline. Each of these data sources has specific strengths and limitations. Strengths include large sample sizes and longitudinal data across different groups, and in different settings. Addressing limitations leads to challenges in dealing with heterogeneous data collection methods, and addressing missing data, which requires the use of sophisticated statistical techniques. Combining data from multiple databases can mitigate individual study limitations, particularly via the 'epidemiological triangulation' concept. Using such data appropriately holds immense potential to better understand the pathobiology underlying CKD and cognitive impairment. Addressing the inherent challenges with a clear strategy is crucial for advancing our understanding and improving the lives of those affected by both CKD and cognitive impairment.	biobank; chronic kidney disease; cognitive impairment; dementia; epidemiology

Growth-Associated Protein 43 Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid Correspond to the Cerebral Blood Flow Alterations in Alzheimer's Dementia Continuum: An Original Study.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurodegenerative condition that has a growing impact on a global scale. This study aims to examine the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the synaptic biomarker growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) through the utilization of arterial spin labeling (ASL). The research identified noteworthy correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GAP-43 levels, CBF, and cognitive composite scores, especially among participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who possess the APOE-ε4 gene. The study examined 92 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 36 cognitively normal (CN) and 56 MCI. The cognitive status of 42 participants was evaluated using ADNI composite scores. Independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests were used for the comparison of continuous variables between groups, and multiple linear regression analysis with adjustments for confounding factors was used to assess the relationship between GAP-43 and CBF values. Significant positive correlations were observed between GAP-43 levels and (A) the executive function composite score (ADNI_EF) in CN individuals, as well as (B) the language composite score (ADNI_LAN) in individuals with MCI. CSF biomarkers and ASL regions did not show statistical significance between diagnostic groups after correction for multiple comparisons. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between diagnostic groups. However, associations were observed between ROI CBF and Mini Mental State Examination in various subgroups. The findings indicate a potential function for ASL perfusion in identifying early AD-related alterations and gaining insight into the pathophysiology of AD and mild cognitive impairment.The study revealed associations between CBF, cognitive scores, and APOE-ε4 gene status.

A comprehensive interpretable machine learning framework for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.	An interpretable machine learning (ML) framework is introduced to enhance the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) by ensuring robustness of the ML models' interpretations. The dataset used comprises volumetric measurements from brain MRI and genetic data from healthy individuals and patients with MCI/AD, obtained through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The existing class imbalance is addressed by an ensemble learning approach, while various attribution-based and counterfactual-based interpretability methods are leveraged towards producing diverse explanations related to the pathophysiology of MCI/AD. A unification method combining SHAP with counterfactual explanations assesses the interpretability techniques' robustness. The best performing model yielded 87.5% balanced accuracy and 90.8% F1-score. The attribution-based interpretability methods highlighted significant volumetric and genetic features related to MCI/AD risk. The unification method provided useful insights regarding those features' necessity and sufficiency, further showcasing their significance in MCI/AD diagnosis.

Multiple imaging modalities and specific proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid, providing a comprehensive understanding of neurodegenerative disorders, have been widely used for computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the proven effectiveness of contrastive learning in aligning multi-modal representation, in this paper, we investigate effective contrastive learning strategies to learn better cross-modal representations for the integration of multi-modal complementary information. To enhance the overall performance in AD diagnosis, we construct a unified hybrid network that integrates feature learning and classifier learning into an end-to-end framework. Specifically, we propose a weighted multi-modal contrastive learning based on hybrid network (WMCL-HN) method. Firstly, an adaptive weighted strategy is implemented on the multi-modal contrastive learning to dynamically regulate the degree of information exchange across modalities. It assigns higher weights to more important modality pair, thus the most important underlying relationships across modalities can be captured. Secondly, we construct a hybrid network, which employs a curriculum learning strategy that gradually transitions the training from feature learning to classifier learning, ensuring that the learned features are tailored to the diagnostic task. Experimental results on ADNI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed WMCL-HN in AD-related diagnosis tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/pcehnago/WMCL-HN.

Growth-associated protein 43 is associated with faster functional decline among amyloid-positive individuals with objectively defined subtle cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.	Objectively defined subtle cognitive decline (Obj-SCD) is an emerging classification that may identify individuals at risk for future decline and progression to Alzheimer's disease prior to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) marker of synaptic dysfunction, has been shown to relate to an increased risk of converting to dementia, although it is unclear whether GAP-43 alterations may be detected in pre-MCI stages. Therefore, in the present study, we examined CSF GAP-43 levels among individuals with Obj-SCD cross-sectionally and also examined whether baseline GAP-43 predicts future functional decline. Six hundred forty-four participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were divided into six groups based on (a) cognitive status (cognitively unimpaired [CU], Obj-SCD, or MCI) and (b) Aβ status (+ or -). The CU- group had lower baseline GAP-43 than all Aβ+ groups, but not the other Aβ- groups. Higher GAP-43 levels were associated with faster decline across the entire sample. When moderation by group was examined, higher GAP-43 at baseline predicted faster functional decline for the Obj-SCD+ and MCI+ groups, compared to the CU- group. Results extend prior work investigating biomarker associations in Obj-SCD to GAP-43 and show that high baseline CSF GAP-43 is associated with a faster rate of functional decline in Aβ+ individuals who are classified as Obj-SCD or MCI. Importantly, our findings further demonstrate that CSF GAP-43 is associated with early and subtle cognitive changes detectable before the onset of MCI.

We propose a method that uses a two-species ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to characterize misfolded tau (or simply tau) protein spreading in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and calibrates it from clinical data. The unknown model parameters are the initial condition (IC) for tau and three scalar parameters representing the migration, proliferation, and clearance of tau proteins. Driven by imaging data, these parameters are estimated by formulating a constrained optimization problem with a sparsity regularization for the IC. This optimization problem is solved with a projection-based quasi-Newton algorithm. We investigate the sensitivity of our method to different algorithm parameters. We evaluate the performance of our method on both synthetic and clinical data. The latter comprises cases from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets: 455 cognitively normal (CN), 212 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 45 AD subjects. We compare the performance of our approach to the commonly used Fisher-Kolmogorov (FK) model with a fixed IC at the entorhinal cortex (EC). Our method demonstrates an average improvement of 25.7% relative error compared to the FK model on the AD dataset. HFK also achieves an R-squared score of 0.664 for fitting AD data compared with 0.55 from FK model results under the same optimization scheme. Furthermore, for cases that have longitudinal data, we estimate a subject-specific AD onset time.

Alzheimer's disease prediction using 3D-CNNs: Intelligent processing of neuroimaging data.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurological illness that demolishes memory and brain functioning. This disease affects an individual's capacity to work, think, and behave. The proportion of individuals suffering from AD is rapidly increasing. It flatters a leading cause of disability and impacts millions of people worldwide. Early detection reduces disease expansion, provides more effective therapies, and leads to better results. However, predicting AD at an early stage is complex since its clinical symptoms match with normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and neurodegenerative disorders. Prior studies indicate that early diagnosis is improved by the utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, MRI data is scarce, noisy, and extremely diverse among scanners and patient populations. The 2D CNNs analyze 3D data slices separately, resulting in a loss of inter-slice information and contextual coherence required to detect subtle and diffuse brain alterations. This study offered a novel 3Dimensional-Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and intelligent preprocessing pipeline for AD prediction. This work uses an intelligent frame selection and 3D dilated convolutions mechanism to recognize the most informative slices associated with AD disease. This enabled the model to capture subtle and diffuse structural changes across the brain visible in MRI scans. The proposed model examined brain structures by recognizing small volumetric changes associated with AD and acquiring spatial hierarchies within MRI data. After conducting various experiments, we observed that the proposed 3D-CNNs are highly proficient in capturing early brain changes. To validate the model's performance, a benchmark dataset called AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is used and achieves a maximum accuracy of 92.89 %, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.	3D dilated convolutions; 3D-CNN; Alzheimer's disease; Frame selection; MRI scans

Event-based models (EBM) provide an important platform for modeling disease progression. This work successfully extends previous EBM approaches to work with larger sets of biomarkers while simultaneously modeling heterogeneity in disease progression trajectories. We develop and validate the s-SuStain method for scalable event-based modeling of disease progression subtypes using large numbers of features. s-SuStaIn is typically an order of magnitude faster than its predecessor (SuStaIn). Moreover, we perform a case study with s-SuStaIn using open access cross-sectional Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) data to stage AD patients into four subtypes based on dynamic disease progression. s-SuStaIn shows that the inferred subtypes and stages predict progression to AD among MCI subjects. The subtypes show difference in AD incidence-rates and reveal clinically meaningful progression trajectories when mapped to a brain atlas.

Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Progression to Alzheimer's Disease in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is a condition that impairs cognition, memory, and behavior. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage before AD, urgently needs the development of prediction models for conversion from MCI to AD. This study used machine learning methods to predict whether MCI subjects would develop AD, highlighting the importance of biomarkers (biological indicators from neuroimaging, such as MRI and PET scans, and molecular assays from cerebrospinal fluid or blood) and non-biomarker features in AD research and clinical practice. These indicators aid in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and the development of potential treatments for MCI subjects. Using baseline data, which includes measurements of different biomarkers, we predicted disease progression at the patient's last visit. The Shapley value explanation (SHAP) technique was used to identify key features for predicting patient progression. The study used the ADNI database to evaluate the effectiveness of eight classification methods for predicting progression from MCI to AD. Four fundamental data sampling approaches were compared to balance the dataset and reduce overfitting. The SHAP technique improved the ability to identify biomarkers and non-biomarker features, enhancing the prediction of disease progression. NEAR-MISS was found to be the most advantageous sampling method, while XGBoost was found to be the superior classification method, offering enhanced accuracy and predictive power. The proposed SHAP for feature selection combined with XGBoost may provide improved predictive accuracy in diagnosing Alzheimer's patients.

Is late-life vulnerability to cardiovascular disease risk associated with longitudinal tau accumulation in older adults with mild cognitive impairment?	Older females have higher Alzheimer's Disease (AD) risk and tau burden, especially in early disease stages, compared to males. Overlapping cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia risk factors, like the apolipoprotein (APOE)-ε4 allele, show mixed sex-specific results. We previously found that late-life CVD risk related more strongly to tau at a single timepoint in cognitively normal, older female APOE-ε4 carriers than in males. Do composite and component CVD risk factors explain sex differences in tau accumulation in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and underlying amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology? Longitudinal analysis in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. ADNI is a multi-site longitudinal study across the United States and Canada. CVD risk was measured by body mass index (BMI) and FRS, which includes age, systolic blood pressure (BP), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol, hypertension treatment, smoking, and diabetes. Regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were extracted at each tau-PET timepoint. Composite SUVRs for Braak34 and Braak56 were calculated. Statistical models examined the separate and interactive effects of sex and APOE-ε4 on tau accumulation, and moderating effects of FRS, its components, or BMI, on tau accumulation. Females accumulated more tau than males in bilateral Braak34 and right Braak56, while APOE-ε4 carriers trended toward more tau accumulation in left Braak56. FRS and its components did not relate to tau accumulation, nor influence sex effects, although they attenuated APOE-ε4 effects. In left Braak56, higher baseline BMI in males showed a trend toward greater tau accumulation. In MCI and Aβ-positive older adults, females accumulated more tau than males, and late-life vascular risk did not explain this relationship. Higher BMI related to more tau accumulation in males only, suggesting sex-specific vulnerability to BMI on brain health. Although replication in larger and more representative cohorts is needed, these findings corroborate accelerated tau progression in older females, independent of CVD risk, and suggest that vascular health has limited influence on tau progression once AD pathology is established in the brain.

Cardiovascular-derived Circulating Cell-Free DNA Fragments are Associated with Frailty and Increased Cardiovascular Events in Older Adults.	Increased cellular damage in aging tissues releases circulating cell-free genomic DNA (ccf-gDNA) into the bloodstream, and these fragments are associated with a higher risk of frailty and dementia. We hypothesized that identifying the tissue of origin for ccf-gDNA using methylation signatures can distinguish subgroups of participants with distinct clinical outcomes, biological aging rates, and energy use. Serum ccf-gDNA from 181 participants in the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS-MAP) was assessed for DNA methylation at one timepoint using the Illumina Methylation EPIC array. Clinical outcomes six years after ccf-gDNA measurement were determined for the following: frailty, cognitive test scores, and cardiovascular disease. Hierarchical clustering identified major clusters based on the predominance of ccf-gDNA source: Cardiovascular, Erythrocyte Progenitor, and Immune Cell. Participants with cardiovascular-enriched ccf-gDNA (CV ccf-gDNA) had higher rates of myocardial infarction (39%) at the last study visit compared to other subgroups (immune ccf-gDNA 21%, erythrocyte ccf-gDNA 23%), and similar findings were observed for congestive heart disease and stroke. There were no significant associations between cognitive test scores and ccf-gDNA subgroups. Individuals with CV ccf-gDNA demonstrated 3.1 times higher odds of being frail compared to the other groups and showed increased epigenetic age acceleration for the fragments compared to the other subgroups, indicating that this group was enriched with ccf-gDNA originating from older cells. The CV ccf-gDNA subgroup exhibited dysregulation of glycine and serine metabolism and pathways integral to cardiovascular health, endothelial function, and inflammation. We demonstrate that ccf-gDNA methylation patterns can detect high-turnover tissues and identify older adults at higher risk of frailty and cardiovascular disease.

Loss of the APP regulator RHBDL4 preserves memory in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.	Characteristic cerebral pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as glucose hypometabolism or the accumulation of cleavage products of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), known as Aβ peptides, lead to sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and neurodegeneration. To preserve ER homeostasis, cells activate their unfolded protein response (UPR). The rhomboid-like-protease 4 (RHBDL4) is an enzyme that participates in the UPR by targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation. We demonstrated previously that RHBDL4 cleaves APP in HEK293T cells, leading to decreased total APP and Aβ. More recently, we showed that RHBDL4 processes APP in mouse primary mixed cortical cultures as well. Here, we aim to examine the physiological relevance of RHBDL4 in the brain. We first found that brain samples from AD patients and an AD mouse model (APPtg) showed increased RHBDL4 mRNA and protein expression. To determine the effects of RHBDL4's absence on APP physiology in vivo, we crossed APPtg mice to a RHBDL4 knockout (R4

Analysis of human brain RNA-seq data reveals combined effects of 4 types of RNA modifications and 18 types of programmed cell death on Alzheimer's disease.	RNA modification plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by modulating the expression and function of AD-related genes, thereby affecting AD occurrence and progression. Programmed cell death is closely related to neuronal death and associated with neuronal loss and cognitive function changes in AD. However, the mechanism of their joint action on AD remains unknown and requires further exploration. We used the MSBB RNA-seq dataset to analyze the correlation between RNA modification, programmed cell death, and AD. We used combined studies of RNA modification and programmed cell death to distinguish subgroups of patients, and the results highlight the strong correlation between RNA modification-related programmed cell death and AD. A weighted gene co-expression network was constructed, and the pivotal roles of programmed cell death genes in key modules were identified. Finally, by combining unsupervised consensus clustering, gene co-expression networks, and machine learning algorithms, an RNA modification-related programmed cell death network was constructed, and the pivotal roles of programmed cell death genes in key modules were identified. An RNA modification-related programmed cell death risk score was calculated to predict the occurrence of AD. RPCD-related genes classified patients into subgroups with distinct clinical characteristics. Nineteen key genes were identified and an RPCD risk score was constructed based on the key genes. This score can be used for the diagnosis of AD and the assessment of disease progression in patients. The diagnostic efficacy of the RPCD risk score and the key genes was validated in the ROSMAP, GEO, and ADNI datasets. This study uncovered that RNA modification-related PCD is of significance for AD progression and early prediction, providing insights from a new perspective for the study of disease mechanisms in AD.

Integrative network analysis reveals novel moderators of Aβ-Tau interaction in Alzheimer's disease.	Although interactions between amyloid-beta and tau proteins have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the precise mechanisms by which these interactions contribute to disease progression are not yet fully understood. Moreover, despite the growing application of deep learning in various biomedical fields, its application in integrating networks to analyze disease mechanisms in AD research remains limited. In this study, we employed BIONIC, a deep learning-based network integration method, to integrate proteomics and protein-protein interaction data, with an aim to uncover factors that moderate the effects of the Aβ-tau interaction on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage AD. Proteomic data from the ROSMAP cohort were integrated with protein-protein interaction (PPI) data using a Deep Learning-based model. Linear regression analysis was applied to histopathological and gene expression data, and mutual information was used to detect moderating factors. Statistical significance was determined using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (p < 0.05). Our results suggested that astrocytes and GPNMB + microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction. Based on linear regression with histopathological and gene expression data, GFAP and IBA1 levels and GPNMB gene expression positively contributed to the interaction of tau with Aβ in non-dementia cases, replicating the results of the network analysis. These findings suggest that GPNMB + microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction in early AD and therefore are a novel therapeutic target. To facilitate further research, we have made the integrated network available as a visualization tool for the scientific community (URL: https://igcore.cloud/GerOmics/AlzPPMap ).

Gene Co-Expression Analysis Reveals Functional Differences Between Early- and Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.	The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly among older adults, has driven increased research into its underlying mechanisms and risk factors. Aging, genetic susceptibility, and cardiovascular health are recognized contributors to AD, but how the age of onset affects disease progression remains underexplored. This study investigates the role of early- versus late-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD and LOAD, respectively) in shaping the trajectory of cognitive decline. Leveraging data from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), two cohorts were established: individuals with early-onset AD and those with late-onset AD. Comprehensive analyses, including differential gene expression profiling, pathway enrichment, and gene co-expression network construction, were conducted to identify distinct molecular signatures associated with each cohort. Network modularity learning algorithms were used to discern the inner structure of co-expression networks and their related functional features. Computed network descriptors provided deeper insights into the influence of age at onset on the biological progression of AD.

Dynamic lifetime risk prediction of Alzheimer's disease with longitudinal cognitive assessment measurements.	The progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) highlights the importance of predicting lifetime risk and updating assessments as new data emerge. This study aimed to develop a dynamic model using longitudinal cognitive assessments for updated risk predictions. This study used data from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) to develop a dynamic risk prediction model based on five cognitive domains, updated annually over 10 years. The lifetime prediction models based on 2384 participants showed improved area under the curve (AUC) over time, rising from 0.578 at baseline to 0.765 with 10 years of data. The models predicting AD onset before ages 85 and 90 showed superior performance, with AUCs increasing from 0.761 to 0.932 and 0.658 to 0.876, respectively. Incorporating longitudinal cognitive assessments improves AD risk prediction as more data become available. Future research should integrate diverse data types to further boost predictive accuracy. Developed a dynamic lifetime risk prediction model. The area under the curve (AUC) increased from 0.578 at baseline to 0.765 with 10 years of data. The models predicting pre-85 and pre-90 risks demonstrated superior performance.	Alzheimer's disease; cognitive assessment; dynamic risk prediction

Structural variants linked to Alzheimer's disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with substantial genetic influence. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous risk loci for late-onset AD (LOAD), the functional mechanisms underlying most of these associations remain unresolved. Large genomic rearrangements, known as structural variants (SVs), represent a promising avenue for elucidating such mechanisms within some of these loci. By leveraging data from two ongoing cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), we performed genome-wide association analysis testing 20,205 common SVs from 1088 participants with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. A range of Alzheimer's disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits were examined. First, we mapped SVs across 81 AD risk loci and discovered 22 SVs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS lead variants and directly associated with the phenotypes tested. The strongest association was a deletion of an Alu element in the 3'UTR of the TMEM106B gene, in high LD with the respective AD GWAS locus and associated with multiple AD and AD-related disorders (ADRD) phenotypes, including tangles density, TDP-43, and cognitive resilience. The deletion of this element was also linked to lower TMEM106B protein abundance. We also found a 22-kb deletion associated with depression in ROS/MAP and bearing similar association patterns as GWAS SNPs at the IQCK locus. In addition, we leveraged our catalog of SV-GWAS to replicate and characterize independent findings in SV-based GWAS for AD and five other neurodegenerative diseases. Among these findings, we highlight the replication of genome-wide significant SVs for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), including markers for the 17q21.31 MAPT locus inversion and a 1483-bp deletion at the CYP2A13 locus, along with other suggestive associations, such as a 994-bp duplication in the LMNTD1 locus, suggestively linked to AD and a 3958-bp deletion at the DOCK5 locus linked to Lewy body disease (LBD) (P = 3.36 × 10 While still limited in sample size, this study highlights the utility of including analysis of SVs for elucidating mechanisms underlying GWAS loci and provides a valuable resource for the characterization of the effects of SVs in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.

Deciphering novel mitochondrial signatures: multi-omics analysis uncovers cross-disease markers and oligodendrocyte pathways in Alzheimer's disease and glioblastoma.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glioblastoma (GBM) are severe neurological disorders that pose significant global healthcare challenges. Despite extensive research, the molecular mechanisms, particularly those involving mitochondrial dysfunction, remain poorly understood. A major limitation in current studies is the lack of cell-specific markers that effectively represent mitochondrial dynamics in AD and GBM. In this study, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomic data using 10 machine learning algorithms to identify mitochondria-associated cell-specific markers. We validated these markers through the integration of gene expression and methylation data across diverse cell types. Our dataset comprised single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) from AD patients, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from GBM patients, and additional DNA methylation and transcriptomic data from the ROSMAP, ADNI, TCGA, and CGGA cohorts. Our analysis identified four significant cross-disease mitochondrial markers:	Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; glioblastoma; mitochondria; multi-omics

Proteome-Wide Association Study for Finding Druggable Targets in Progression and Onset of Parkinson's Disease.	To identify and validate causal protein targets that may serve as potential therapeutic interventions for both the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) through integrative proteomic and genetic analyses. We utilized large-scale plasma and brain protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) datasets from the deCODE Health study and the Religious Orders Study/Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), respectively. Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) were conducted using the OTTERS framework for plasma proteins and the FUSION tool for brain proteins, examining associations with PD onset and three progression phenotypes: composite, motor, and cognitive. Significant protein associations (FDR-corrected p < 0.05) from PWAS were further validated using summary-based Mendelian randomization (SMR), colocalization analyses, and reverse Mendelian randomization (MR) to establish causality. Phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (PheW-MR) was performed to assess potential side effects across 679 disease traits when targeting these proteins to reduce PD-related phenotype risk by 20%. Additionally, we conducted cellular distribution-based clustering using gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) to explore the distribution of key proteins across brain regions, constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks via the STRING database to explore interactions among proteins, and evaluated the druggability of identified targets using the DrugBank database to identify opportunities for drug repurposing. Our analyses identified 25 candidate proteins associated with PD phenotypes, including 16 plasma proteins linked to PD progression (10 cognitive, 4 motor, and 3 composite) and 9 plasma proteins associated with PD onset. Notably, GPNMB was implicated in both plasma and brain tissues for PD onset. PheW-MR revealed predominantly beneficial side effects for the identified targets, with 83.7% of associations indicating positive outcomes and 16.3% indicating adverse effects. Cellular clustering categorized candidate targets into three distinct expression profiles across brain cell types using ABA. PPI network analysis highlighted one key interaction cluster among the proteins for PD cognitive progression and PD onset. Druggability assessment revealed 15 out of 25 proteins had repurposing opportunities for PD treatment. We have identified 25 causal protein targets associated with the onset and progression of PD, providing new insights into the research and development of treatment strategies for PD.

Human herpesvirus-associated transposable element activation in human aging brains with Alzheimer's disease.	Human herpesvirus (HHV) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We leveraged functional genomics data from Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) brain biobanks and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from HHV-infected forebrain organoids to investigate HHV-infection-associated transposable element (TE) dysregulation underlying AD etiologies. We identified widespread TE dysregulation in HHV-positive human AD brains, including an astrocyte-specific upregulation of LINE1 subfamily TEs in HHV-positive human AD brains. We further pinpointed astrocyte-specific LINE1 upregulation that could potentially regulate target gene NEAT1 expression via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions. This LINE1 dysregulation can be partially reversed by the usage of anti-HHV drugs (valacyclovir and acyclovir) in a virus-infected human brain organoid model. Finally, we demonstrated that valacyclovir rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated LINE1 activation in an experimental tau aggregation model. Our analysis provides associations linking molecular, clinical, and neuropathological AD features with HHV infection, which warrants future clinical validation. Via analysis of bulk RNA-seq data in two large-scale human brain biobanks, ROS/MAP (n = 109 pathologically confirmed AD and n = 44 cognitively healthy controls) and MSBB (n = 284 AD and n = 150 cognitively healthy controls), we identified widespread TE activation in HHV-positive human AD brains and significantly positive associations of HHV RNA abundance with APOE4 genotype, Braak staging score, and CERAD score. We identified cell type-specific LINE1 upregulation in both microglia and astrocytes of human AD brains via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions on lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1). We determined that usage of valacyclovir and acyclovir was significantly associated with reduced incidence of AD in a large real-world patient database. Using the HEK293 tau P301S model and U2OS mt-Keima cell model, we determined that valacyclovir treatment rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated activation of LINE1 with increased cellular autophagy-level mechanistically supported clinical benefits of valacyclovir in real-world patient data.

Gene module-trait network analysis uncovers cell type specific systems and genes relevant to Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is marked by the accumulation of pathology, neuronal loss, and gliosis and frequently accompanied by cognitive decline. Understanding brain cell interactions is key to identifying new therapeutic targets to slow its progression. Here, we used systems biology methods to analyze single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNASeq) data generated from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissues of 424 participants in the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). We identified modules of co-regulated genes in seven major cell types, assigned them to coherent cellular processes, and assessed which modules were associated with AD traits such as cognitive decline, tangle density, and amyloid-β deposition. Coexpression network structure was conserved in the majority of modules across cell types, but we also found distinct communities with altered connectivity, especially when compared to bulk RNASeq, suggesting cell-specific gene co-regulation. These coexpression modules can also capture signatures of cell subpopulations and be influenced by cell proportions. Using a Bayesian network framework, we modeled the direction of relationships between the modules and AD progression. We highlight two key modules, a microglia module (mic_M46), associated with tangles; and an astrocyte module (ast_M19), associated with cognitive decline. Our work provides cell-specific molecular networks modeling the molecular events leading to AD.

Transcriptomic analyses of human brains with Alzheimer's disease identified dysregulated epilepsy-causing genes.	Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients at multiple stages of disease progression have a high prevalence of seizures. However, whether AD and epilepsy share pathophysiological changes remains poorly defined. In this study, we leveraged high-throughput transcriptomic data from sporadic AD cases at different stages of cognitive impairment across multiple independent cohorts and brain regions to examine the role of epilepsy-causing genes. Epilepsy-causing genes were manually curated, and their expression levels were analyzed across bulk transcriptomic data from three AD cohorts and three brain regions. RNA-seq data from sporadic AD and control cases from the Knight ADRC, MSBB, and ROSMAP cohorts were processed and analyzed under the same analytical pipeline. An integrative clustering approach employing machine learning and multi-omics data was employed to identify molecularly defined profiles with different cognitive scores. We found several epilepsy-associated genes/pathways significantly dysregulated in a group of AD patients with more severe cognitive impairment. We observed 15 genes consistently downregulated across the three cohorts, including sodium and potassium channels, suggesting that these genes play fundamental roles in cognitive function or AD progression. Notably, we found 25 of these genes dysregulated in earlier stages of AD and become worse with AD progression. Our findings showed that epilepsy-causing genes showed changes in the early and late stages of AD progression, suggesting that they might be playing a role in AD progression. We can not establish directionality or cause-effect with our findings. However, changes in the epilepsy-causing genes might underlie the presence of seizures in AD patients, which might be present before or concurrently with the initial stages of AD.

Cellular senescence induced by cholesterol accumulation is mediated by lysosomal ABCA1 in APOE4 and AD.	Cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cholesterol accumulation is known to drive cellular senescence; however, its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis, and its expression and trafficking are altered in APOE4 and AD models. However, the role of ABCA1 trafficking in cellular senescence associated with APOE4 and AD remains unclear. We examined the association between cellular senescence and ABCA1 expression in human postmortem brain samples using transcriptomic, histological, and biochemical analyses. Unbiased proteomic screening was performed to identify the proteins that mediate cellular ABCA1 trafficking. We created ABCA1 knock out cell lines and mouse models to validate the role of ABCA1 in cholesterol-induced mTORC1 activation and senescence. Additionally, we used APOE4-TR mice and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models to explore cholesterol-ABCA1-senescence pathways. Transcriptomic profiling of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from the Religious Order Study/Memory Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort revealed the upregulation of cellular senescence transcriptome signatures in AD, which correlated with ABCA1 expression and oxysterol levels. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analyses confirmed increased lipofuscin-stained lipids and ABCA1 expression in AD brains and an association with mTOR phosphorylation. Discovery proteomics identified caveolin-1, a sensor of cellular cholesterol accumulation, as a key promoter of ABCA1 endolysosomal trafficking. Greater caveolin-1 expression was observed in APOE4-TR mouse models and AD human brains. Oxysterol induced mTORC1 activation and senescence were regulated by ABCA1 lysosomal trapping. Treatment of APOE4-TR mice with cyclodextrin reduced brain oxysterol levels, ABCA1 lysosome trapping, mTORC1 activation, and attenuated senescence and neuroinflammation markers. In human iPSC-derived astrocytes, the reduction of cholesterol by cyclodextrin attenuated inflammatory responses. Oxysterol accumulation in APOE4 and AD induced ABCA1 and caveolin-1 expression, contributing to lysosomal dysfunction and increased cellular senescence markers. This study provides novel insights into how cholesterol metabolism accelerates features of brain cellular senescence pathway and identifies therapeutic targets to mitigate these processes.

Molecular hallmarks of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal resilience and resistance to Alzheimer's disease.	A significant proportion of individuals maintain healthy cognitive function despite having extensive Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, known as cognitive resilience. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that protect these individuals can identify therapeutic targets for AD dementia. This study aims to define molecular and cellular signatures of cognitive resilience, protection and resistance, by integrating genetics, bulk RNA, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data across multiple brain regions from AD, resilient, and control individuals. We analyzed data from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), including bulk (n=631) and multi-regional single nucleus (n=48) RNA sequencing. Subjects were categorized into AD, resilient, and control based on β-amyloid and tau pathology, and cognitive status. We identified and prioritized protected cell populations using whole genome sequencing-derived genetic variants, transcriptomic profiling, and cellular composition distribution. Transcriptomic results, supported by GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores, place cognitive resilience as an intermediate state in the AD continuum. Tissue-level analysis revealed 43 genes enriched in nucleic acid metabolism and signaling that were differentially expressed between AD and resilience. Only GFAP (upregulated) and KLF4 (downregulated) showed differential expression in resilience compared to controls. Cellular resilience involved reorganization of protein folding and degradation pathways, with downregulation of Hsp90 and selective upregulation of Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp110 families in excitatory neurons. Excitatory neuronal subpopulations in the entorhinal cortex (ATP8B1+ and MEF2C We identified molecular and cellular hallmarks of cognitive resilience, an intermediate state in the AD continuum. Resilience mechanisms include preservation of neuronal function, maintenance of excitatory/inhibitory balance, and activation of protective signaling pathways. Specific excitatory neuronal populations appear to play a central role in mediating cognitive resilience, while a subset of vulnerable SST interneurons likely provide compensation against AD-associated dysregulation. This study offers a framework to leverage natural protective mechanisms to mitigate neurodegeneration and preserve cognition in AD.

Zim4rv: an R package to modeling zero-inflated count phenotype on regional-based rare variants.	With the advance of next-generation sequencing, various gene-based rare variant association tests have been developed, particularly for binary and continuous phenotypes. In contrast, fewer methods are available for traits not following binomial or normal distributions. To address this, we previously proposed a set of burden- and kernel-based rare variant tests for count data following zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) distributions, referred to as ZIP-b and ZIP-k tests. We sought to extend the methods to accommodate negative binomial distribution and implemented these tests in a new R package. We introduce ZIM4rv, an R package designed to analyze the association of rare variants with zero-inflated counts outcomes. Our package offers two novel models developed by our team: our previously proposed ZIP-b and ZIP-k tests, and the newly derived Negative Binomial Burden and Kernel Test (ZINB-b, ZINB-k). Additionally, we include an ad-hoc two-stage analysis, testing zero and non-zero as a binary outcome and non-zero as a continuous outcome, respectively. To showcase the utility of our platform, we applied this program to analyze neuritic plaque count data from the ROSMAP cohort.

Predicting Alzheimer's disease subtypes and understanding their molecular characteristics in living patients with transcriptomic trajectory profiling.	Deciphering the diverse molecular mechanisms in living Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is a big challenge but is pivotal for disease prognosis and precision medicine development. Utilizing an optimal transport approach, we conducted graph-based mapping of transcriptomic profiles to transfer AD subtype labels from ROSMAP monocyte samples to ADNI and ANMerge peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Subsequently, differential expression followed by comparative pathway and diffusion pseudotime analysis were applied to each cohort to infer the progression trajectories. Survival analysis with real follow-up time was used to obtain potential biomarkers for AD prognosis. AD subtype labels were accurately transferred onto the blood samples of ADNI and ANMerge living patients. Pathways and associated genes in neutrophil degranulation-like immune process, immune acute phase response, and IL-6 signaling were significantly associated with AD progression. The work enhanced our understanding of AD progression in different subtypes, offering insights into potential biomarkers and personalized interventions for improved patient care. We applied an innovative optimal transport-based approach to map transcriptomic data from different Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort studies and transfer known AD subtype labels from ROSMAP monocyte samples to peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples within ADNI and ANMerge cohorts. Through comprehensive trajectory and comparative analysis, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying different disease progression trajectories in AD. We validated the accuracy of our AD subtype label transfer and identified prognostic genetic markers associated with disease progression, facilitating personalized treatment strategies. By identifying and predicting distinctive AD subtypes and their associated pathways, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of AD heterogeneity.

Cell Type Differentiation Using Network Clustering Algorithms.	Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies provide unprecedented resolution representing transcriptomics at the level of single cell. One of the biggest challenges in scRNA-seq data analysis is the cell type annotation, which is usually inferred by cell separation approaches. In-silico algorithms that accurately identify individual cell types in ongoing single-cell sequencing studies are crucial for unlocking cellular heterogeneity and understanding the biological basis of diseases. In this study, we focus on robustly identifying cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing data; we conduct a comparative analysis using methods established in biology, like Seurat, Leiden, and WGCNA, as well as Infomap, statistical inference via Stochastic Block Models (SBM), and single-cell Graph Neural Networks (scGNN). We also analyze preprocessing pipelines to identify and optimize key components in the process. Leveraging two independent datasets, PBMC and ROSMAP, we employ clustering algorithms on cell-cell networks derived from gene expression data. Our findings reveal that while clusters detected by WGCNA exhibit limited correspondence with cell types, those identified by multiresolution Infomap and Leiden, and SBM show a closer alignment, with Infomap standing out as a particularly effective approach. Infomap notably offers valuable insights for the precise characterization of cellular landscapes related to neurodegenration and immunology in scRNA-seq.	cell separation; network clustering; single-cell RNA-seq

Association of ten VEGF family genes with Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes at single cell resolution.	Using a single-nucleus transcriptome derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 424 Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) participants, we investigated the cell type-specific effect of ten vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) genes on Alzheimer's disease (AD) endophenotypes. Negative binomial mixed models were used for differential gene expression and association analysis with AD endophenotypes. VEGF-associated intercellular communication was also profiled. Higher microglia FLT1, endothelial FLT4, and oligodendrocyte VEGFB are associated with greater amyloid beta (Aβ) load, whereas higher VEGFB expression in inhibitory neurons is associated with lower Aβ load. Higher astrocyte NRP1 is associated with lower tau density. Higher microglia and endothelial FLT1 are associated with worse cognition performance. Endothelial and microglial FLT1 expression was upregulated in clinical AD patients compared to cognitively normal controls. Finally, AD cells showed a significant reduction in VEGF signaling compared to controls. Our results highlight key changes in VEGF receptor expression in endothelial and microglial cells during AD, and the potential protective role of VEGFB in neurons. The prefrontal cortical expression of FLT1 and FLT4 was associated with worse cross-sectional global cognitive function, longitudinal cognitive trajectories, and more Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. The associations between FLT1 or FLT4 and AD endophenotypes appear to be driven by endothelial and microglial cells. VEGFB expression seems to have opposing effects on the Aβ burden in AD depending on cell types, highlighting its potential protective role in neurons.

Cellular senescence is a major contributor to aging-related degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) but much less is known on the key cell types and pathways driving mechanisms of senescence in the brain. We hypothesized that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism is central to cellular senescence in AD. We analyzed whole transcriptomic data and utilized single-cell RNA seq integration techniques to unveil the convoluted cell-type-specific and sub-cell-type-state-specific senescence pathologies in AD using both ROSMAP and Sea-AD datasets. We identified that microglia are central components to AD associated senescence phenotypes in ROSMAP snRNA-seq data (982,384 nuclei from postmortem prefrontal cortex of 239 AD and 188 non-AD) among non-neuron cell types. We identified that homeostatic, inflammatory, phagocytic, lipid processing and neuronal surveillance microglia states were associated with AD associated senescence in ROSMAP (152,459 microglia nuclei from six regions of brain tissue of 138 early AD, 79 late AD and 226 control subject) and in Sea-AD (82,486 microglia nuclei of 42 dementia, 42 no dementia and 5 reference subjects) via integrative analysis, which preserves the meaningful biological information of microglia cell states across the datasets. We assessed top senescence associated bioprocesses including mitochondrial, apoptosis, oxidative stress, ER stress, endosomes, and lysosomes systems. Specifically, we found that senescent microglia have altered cholesterol related bioprocesses and dysregulated cholesterol. We discovered three gene co-expression modules, which represent the specific cholesterol related senescence transcriptomic signatures in postmortem brains. To validate these findings, the activation of specific cholesterol associated senescence transcriptomic signatures was assessed using integrative analysis of snRNA-seq data from iMGs (microglia induced from iPSCs) exposed to myelin, Abeta, and synaptosomes (56,454 microglia across two replicates of untreated and four treated groups). In vivo cholesterol associated senescence transcriptomic signatures were preserved and altered after treatment with AD pathological substrates in iMGs. This study provides the first evidence that dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism in microglia is a major driver of senescence pathologies in AD. Targeting cholesterol pathways in senescent microglia is an attractive strategy to slow down AD progression.

Pathologic and clinical correlates of region-specific brain GFAP in Alzheimer's disease.	Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an emerging biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with higher blood GFAP levels linked to faster cognitive decline, particularly among individuals with high brain amyloid burden. However, few studies have examined brain GFAP expression to clarify if peripheral associations reflect brain changes. This study aimed to correlate region-specific GFAP mRNA expression (n = 917) and protein abundance (n=386) with diverse neuropathological measures at autopsy in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and to characterize the interaction between brain GFAP and brain amyloid burden on downstream outcomes. We assessed GFAP gene expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, and posterior cingulate cortex with respect to core AD pathology (amyloid-β and tau), cerebrovascular (microinfarcts, macroinfarcts, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy [CAA]), proteinopathic (TDP-43, Lewy bodies), and cognitive outcomes. These associations were further examined at the protein level using tandem-mass tag proteomic measurements from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We also assessed GFAP interactions with AD neuropathology on downstream outcomes. Cortical GFAP gene and protein expression were significantly upregulated in participants with a neuropathologically confirmed AD diagnosis at autopsy (all P	Alzheimer’s disease; Astrocytes; Biomarkers; GFAP; Proteomics; Transcriptomics

Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases 2 (NMNAT2) is a crucial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-synthesizing enzyme essential for neuronal health. In the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), human brain levels of NMNAT2 mRNA positively correlated with cognitive capabilities in older adults. NMNAT2 mRNA abundance is significantly reduced following various insults or proteinopathies. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of NMNAT2, we employed circular chromosome conformation capture followed by high-throughput sequencing (4C-seq) to identify potential NMNAT2 enhancer and silencer regions by determining genomic regions interacting with the NMNAT2 promoter in human SH-SY5Y cells. We discovered distinct NMNAT2 promoter interactomes in undifferentiated versus neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells. Utilizing bioinformatics analyses, we identified putative transcriptional factors and NMNAT2-associated genes. Notably, the mRNA levels of many of these genes showed a significant correlation with NMNAT2 mRNA levels in ∼400 single-nuclei RNA-seq datasets from ROSMAP. Additionally, using CRISPR-Cas9 strategies, we confirmed the requirement of two specific genomic regions within the interactomes and four transcription factors in regulating NMNAT2 transcription. In summary, our study identifies genomic loci containing NMNAT2 regulatory elements and predicts associated genes and transcription factors through computational analyses.

Integrative Network Analysis Reveals Novel Moderators of Aβ-Tau Interaction in Alzheimer's Disease.	Although interactions between amyloid-beta and tau proteins have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the precise mechanisms by which these interactions contribute to disease progression are not yet fully understood. Moreover, despite the growing application of deep learning in various biomedical fields, its application in integrating networks to analyze disease mechanisms in AD research remains limited. In this study, we employed BIONIC, a deep learning-based network integration method, to integrate proteomics and protein-protein interaction data, with an aim to uncover factors that moderate the effects of the Aβ-tau interaction on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage AD. Proteomic data from the ROSMAP cohort were integrated with protein-protein interaction (PPI) data using a Deep Learning-based model. Linear regression analysis was applied to histopathological and gene expression data, and mutual information was used to detect moderating factors. Statistical significance was determined using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (p < 0.05). Our results suggested that astrocytes and GPNMB+ microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction. Based on linear regression with histopathological and gene expression data, GFAP and IBA1 levels and These findings indicate that GPNMB+ microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction in early AD and therefore are a novel therapeutic target. To facilitate further research, we have made the integrated network available as a visualization tool for the scientific community (URL: https://igcore.cloud/GerOmics/AlzPPMap).

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of physiological and pathological processes, with their dysregulation increasingly implicated in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using spatial transcriptomics, we analyzed 78 postmortem brain sections from 21 ROSMAP participants to map the spatial expression of lncRNAs in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of aged human brains. Compared to mRNAs, lncRNAs exhibited greater subregion-specific expression, with enrichment in antisense and lincRNA biotypes. Network analysis identified 193 gene modules across eight subregions, including lncRNA-enriched modules involved in critical biological processes. We also identified AD differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs, which showed greater subregion specificity than AD DE mRNAs. Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted the involvement of these AD DE lncRNAs in epigenetic regulation and chromatin remodeling, including enrichment for HDAC target genes such as OIP5-AS1. Statistical modeling suggested that interactions between OIP5-AS1 and HDAC proteins, particularly HDAC11, were associated with tau tangles in excitatory neurons and plaque burden in microglia. This study provides a comprehensive resource of lncRNA spatial expression in the aged human brain and uncovers potential functional roles of lncRNAs in AD pathogenesis.

SGUQ: Staged Graph Convolution Neural Network for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis using Multi-Omics Data.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia, significantly impacting cost, mortality, and burden worldwide. The advent of high-throughput omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics, has revolutionized the molecular understanding of AD. Conventional AI approaches typically require the completion of all omics data at the outset to achieve optimal AD diagnosis, which are inefficient and may be unnecessary. To reduce the clinical cost and improve the accuracy of AD diagnosis using multi-omics data, we propose a novel staged graph convolutional network with uncertainty quantification (SGUQ). SGUQ begins with mRNA and progressively incorporates DNA methylation and miRNA data only when necessary, reducing overall costs and exposure to harmful tests. Experimental results indicate that 46.23% of the samples can be reliably predicted using only single-modal omics data (mRNA), while an additional 16.04% of the samples can achieve reliable predictions when combining two omics data types (mRNA + DNA methylation). In addition, the proposed staged SGUQ achieved an accuracy of 0.858 on ROSMAP dataset, which outperformed existing methods significantly. The proposed SGUQ can not only be applied to AD diagnosis using multi-omics data, but also has the potential for clinical decision making using multi-viewed data.

Apolipoprotein B (APOB), a receptor-binding protein present in cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). High levels of APOB-containing low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are linked to the pathogenesis of both early-onset familial and late-onset sporadic AD. Rare coding mutations in the APOB gene are associated with familial AD, suggesting a role for APOB-bound lipoproteins in the central nervous system. This research explores APOB gene regulation across the AD spectrum using four cohorts: BRAINEAC (elderly control brains), DBCBB (controls, AD brains), ROSMAP (controls, MCI, AD brains), and ADNI (control, MCI, AD clinical subjects). APOB protein levels, measured via mass spectrometry and ELISA, positively correlated with AD pathology indices and cognition, while APOB mRNA levels showed negative correlations. Brain APOB protein levels are also correlated with cortical Aβ levels. A common coding variant in the APOB gene locus affected its expression but didn't impact AD risk or brain cholesterol concentrations, except for 24-S-hydroxycholesterol. Polymorphisms in the CYP27A1 gene, notably rs4674344, were associated with APOB protein levels. A negative correlation was observed between brain APOB gene expression and AD biomarker levels. CSF APOB correlated with Tau pathology in presymptomatic subjects, while cortical APOB was strongly associated with cortical Aβ deposition in late-stage AD. The study discusses the potential link between blood-brain barrier dysfunction and AD symptoms in relation to APOB neurobiology. Overall, APOB's involvement in lipoprotein metabolism appears to influence AD pathology across different stages of the disease.

The ROSMAP project: aging and neurodegenerative diseases through omic sciences.	The Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) is an initiative that integrates two longitudinal cohort studies, which have been collecting clinicopathological and molecular data since the early 1990s. This extensive dataset includes a wide array of omic data, revealing the complex interactions between molecular levels in neurodegenerative diseases (ND) and aging. Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are frequently associated with morbidity and cognitive decline in older adults. Omics research, in conjunction with clinical variables, is crucial for advancing our understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This summary reviews the extensive omics research-encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, and multiomics-conducted through the ROSMAP study. It highlights the significant advancements in understanding the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease.

Development and validation of the Florey Dementia Risk Score web-based tool to screen for Alzheimer's disease in primary care.	It is estimated that ∼60% of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are undetected or undiagnosed, with higher rates of underdiagnosis in low-to middle-income areas with limited medical resources. To promote health equity, we have developed a web-based tool that utilizes easy-to-collect clinical data to enhance AD detection rate in primary care settings. This study was leveraged on the data collected from participants of the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle (AIBL) study and the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). The study included three phases: (1) constructing and evaluating a model on retrospective cohort data (1407 AIBL participants), (2) performing simulated trials to assess model accuracy (30 AIBL participants) and missing data tolerability (30 AIBL participants), and (3) external evaluation using a non-Australian dataset (500 ROSMAP participants). The auto-score machine learning algorithm was employed to develop the Florey Dementia Risk Score (FDRS). All the simulated trials and evaluation were performed using a web-based FDRS tool. FDRS achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of approximately 0.82 [95% CI, 0.75-0.88], with a sensitivity of 0.74 [0.60-0.86] and a specificity of 0.73 [0.70-0.79]. The accuracy of the simulated pilot trial for 30 AIBL participants with complete record was 87% (26/30 correct), while it only slightly decreased (80.0-83.3%, depending on imputation methods) for another 30 AIBL participants with one or two missing data. FDRS achieved an AUC of 0.82 [0.77-0.86] of 500 ROSMAP participants. The FDRS tool offers a potential low-cost solution to AD screening in primary care. The present study warrants future trials of FDRS for optimization and to confirm its generalizability across a more diverse population, especially people in low-income countries.

An explainable graph neural network approach for effectively integrating multi-omics with prior knowledge to identify biomarkers from interacting biological domains.	The rapid growth of multi-omics datasets, in addition to the wealth of existing biological prior knowledge, necessitates the development of effective methods for their integration. Such methods are essential for building predictive models and identifying disease-related molecular markers. We propose a framework for supervised integration of multi-omics data with biological priors represented as knowledge graphs. Our framework leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the relationships among features from high-dimensional 'omics data and set transformers to integrate low-dimensional representations of 'omics features. Furthermore, our framework incorporates explainability methods to elucidate important biomarkers and extract interaction relationships between biological quantities of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to Alzheimer's disease (AD) multi-omics data from the ROSMAP cohort, showing that the integration of transcriptomics and proteomics data with AD biological domain network priors improves the prediction accuracy of AD status and highlights functional AD biomarkers.

Predicting Alzheimer's Cognitive Resilience Score: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models Using RNA-seq Data.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important research topic. While amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are hallmark pathological features of AD, cognitive resilience (CR) is a phenomenon where cognitive function remains preserved despite the presence of these pathological features. This study aimed to construct and compare predictive machine learning models for CR scores using RNA-seq data from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) cohorts. We evaluated support vector regression (SVR), random forest, XGBoost, linear, and transformer-based models. The SVR model exhibited the best performance, with contributing genes identified using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) scores, providing insights into biological pathways associated with CR. Finally, we developed a tool called the resilience gene analyzer (REGA), which visualizes SHAP scores to interpret the contributions of individual genes to CR. REGA is available at https://igcore.cloud/GerOmics/REsilienceGeneAnalyzer/.	Alzheimer’s disease; Shapley additive explanations; machine learning; resilience gene analyzer; transcriptomics

AutoFocus: a hierarchical framework to explore multi-omic disease associations spanning multiple scales of biomolecular interaction.	Recent advances in high-throughput measurement technologies have enabled the analysis of molecular perturbations associated with disease phenotypes at the multi-omic level. Such perturbations can range in scale from fluctuations of individual molecules to entire biological pathways. Data-driven clustering algorithms have long been used to group interactions into interpretable functional modules; however, these modules are typically constrained to a fixed size or statistical cutoff. Furthermore, modules are often analyzed independently of their broader biological context. Consequently, such clustering approaches limit the ability to explore functional module associations with disease phenotypes across multiple scales. Here, we introduce AutoFocus, a data-driven method that hierarchically organizes biomolecules and tests for phenotype enrichment at every level within the hierarchy. As a result, the method allows disease-associated modules to emerge at any scale. We evaluated this approach using two datasets: First, we explored associations of biomolecules from the multi-omic QMDiab dataset (n = 388) with the well-characterized type 2 diabetes phenotype. Secondly, we utilized the ROS/MAP Alzheimer's disease dataset (n = 500), consisting of high-throughput measurements of brain tissue to explore modules associated with multiple Alzheimer's Disease-related phenotypes. Our method identifies modules that are multi-omic, span multiple pathways, and vary in size. We provide an interactive tool to explore this hierarchy at different levels and probe enriched modules, empowering users to examine the full hierarchy, delve into biomolecular drivers of disease phenotype within a module, and incorporate functional annotations.

Network Analysis of Brain and Bone Tissue Transcripts Reveals Shared Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and Osteoporosis.	Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and osteoporosis (OP) are 2 prevalent diseases of aging with demonstrated epidemiological association, but the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to this association are unknown. We used network analysis of bone and brain transcriptomes to discover common molecular mechanisms underlying these 2 diseases. Our study included RNA-sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue of autopsied brains in 629 participants from ROSMAP (Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project), with a subgroup of 298 meeting criteria for inclusion in 5 ADRD categories, and RNA array data from transiliac bone biopsies in 84 participants from the Oslo study of postmenopausal women. After developing each network within each tissue, we analyzed associations between modules (groups of coexpressed genes) with multiple bone and neurological traits, examined overlap in modules between networks, and performed pathway enrichment analysis to discover conserved mechanisms. We discovered 3 modules in ROSMAP that showed significant associations with ADRD and bone-related traits and 4 modules in Oslo that showed significant associations with multiple bone outcomes. We found significant module overlap between the 2 networks in modules linked to signaling, tissue homeostasis, and development, and Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling was found to be highly enriched in OP and ADRD modules of interest. These results provide translational opportunities in the development of treatments and biomarkers for ADRD and OP.	Alzheimer’s disease; Genetics; Osteoporosis

Structural variants linked to Alzheimer's Disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits.	Advances have led to a greater understanding of the genetics of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the gap between the predicted and observed genetic heritability estimates when using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indel data remains. Large genomic rearrangements, known as structural variants (SVs), have the potential to account for this missing genetic heritability. By leveraging data from two ongoing cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), we performed genome-wide association analysis testing around 20,000 common SVs from 1,088 participants with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. A range of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (AD/ADRD) clinical and pathologic traits were examined. Given the limited sample size, no genome-wide significant association was found, but we mapped SVs across 81 AD risk loci and discovered 22 SVs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS lead variants and directly associated with AD/ADRD phenotypes (nominal

Multi-omics analyses highlight molecular differences between clinical and neuropathological diagnoses in Alzheimer's disease.	Both clinical diagnosis and neuropathological diagnosis are commonly used in literature to categorize individuals as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or non-AD in omics analyses. Whether these diagnostic strategies result in distinct profiles of molecular abnormalities is poorly understood. Here, we analysed one of the most commonly used AD omics datasets in the literature from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort and compared the two diagnosis strategies using brain transcriptome and metabolome by grouping individuals as non-AD and AD according to clinical or neuropathological diagnosis separately. Differentially expressed genes, associated pathways related with AD hallmarks and AD-related genes showed that the categorization based on neuropathological diagnosis more accurately reflects the disease state at the molecular level than the categorization based on clinical diagnosis. We further identified consensus biomarker candidates between the two diagnosis strategies such as 5-hydroxylysine, sphingomyelin and 1-myristoyl-2-palmitoyl-GPC as metabolite biomarkers and sphingolipid metabolism as a pathway biomarker, which could be robust AD biomarkers since they are independent of diagnosis strategies. We also used consensus AD and consensus non-AD individuals between the two diagnostic strategies to train a machine-learning based model, which we used to classify the individuals who were cognitively normal but diagnosed as AD based on neuropathological diagnosis (asymptomatic AD individuals). The majority of these individuals were classified as consensus AD patients for both omics data types. Our study provides a detailed characterization of both diagnostic strategies in terms of the association of the corresponding multi-omics profiles with AD.	asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease; candidate biomarkers; clinical diagnosis; metabolic network; metabolome; neuropathological diagnosis; transcriptome

Unveiling promising drug targets for autism spectrum disorder: insights from genetics, transcriptomics, and proteomics.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder for which current treatments are limited and drug development costs are prohibitive. Identifying drug targets for ASD is crucial for the development of targeted therapies. Summary-level data of expression quantitative trait loci obtained from GTEx, protein quantitative trait loci data from the ROSMAP project, and two ASD genome-wide association studies datasets were utilized for discovery and replication. We conducted a combined analysis using Mendelian randomization (MR), transcriptome-wide association studies, Bayesian colocalization, and summary-data-based MR to identify potential therapeutic targets associated with ASD and examine whether there are shared causal variants among them. Furthermore, pathway and drug enrichment analyses were performed to further explore the underlying mechanisms and summarize the current status of pharmacological targets for developing drugs to treat ASD. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and mouse knockout models were performed to estimate the effect of therapeutic targets. A total of 17 genes revealed causal associations with ASD and were identified as potential targets for ASD patients. Cathepsin B (CTSB) [odd ratio (OR) = 2.66 95, confidence interval (CI): 1.28-5.52, P = 8.84 × 10-3], gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1 (GABBR1) (OR = 1.99, 95CI: 1.06-3.75, P = 3.24 × 10-2), and formin like 1 (FMNL1) (OR = 0.15, 95CI: 0.04-0.58, P = 5.59 × 10-3) were replicated in the proteome-wide MR analyses. In Drugbank, two potential therapeutic drugs, Acamprosate (GABBR1 inhibitor) and Bryostatin 1 (CASP8 inhibitor), were inferred as potential influencers of autism. Knockout mouse models suggested the involvement of the CASP8, GABBR1, and PLEKHM1 genes in neurological processes. Our findings suggest 17 candidate therapeutic targets for ASD and provide novel drug targets for therapy development and critical drug repurposing opportunities.

Human brain proteome-wide association study provides insights into the genetic components of protein abundance in obesity.	Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genetic variants associated with obesity. However, most obesity-associated loci were waiting to be translated into new biological insights. Given the critical role of brain in obesity development, we sought to explore whether obesity-associated genetic variants could be mapped to brain protein abundances. We performed proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) and colocalization analyses to identify genes whose cis-regulated brain protein abundances were associated with obesity-related traits, including body fat percentage, trunk fat percentage, body mass index, visceral adipose tissue, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. We then assessed the druggability of the identified genes and conducted pathway enrichment analysis to explore their functional relevance. Finally, we evaluated the effects of the significant PWAS genes at the brain transcriptional level. By integrating human brain proteomes from discovery (ROSMAP, N = 376) and validation datasets (BANNER, N = 198) with genome-wide summary statistics of obesity-related phenotypes (N ranged from 325,153 to 806,834), we identified 51 genes whose cis-regulated brain protein abundance was associated with obesity. These 51 genes were enriched in 11 metabolic processes, e.g., small molecule metabolic process and metabolic pathways. Fourteen of the 51 genes had high drug repurposing value. Ten of the 51 genes were also associated with obesity at the transcriptome level, suggesting that genetic variants likely confer risk of obesity by regulating mRNA expression and protein abundance of these genes. Our study provides new insights into the genetic component of human brain protein abundance in obesity. The identified proteins represent promising therapeutic targets for future drug development.

Women have a higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), even after adjusting for increased longevity. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify genes that underpin sex-associated risk of AD. PIN1 is a key regulator of the tau phosphorylation signaling pathway; however, potential differences in PIN1 expression, in males and females, are still unknown. We analyzed brain transcriptomic datasets focusing on sex differences in PIN1 mRNA levels in an aging and AD cohort, which revealed reduced PIN1 levels primarily within females. We validated this observation in an independent dataset (ROS/MAP), which also revealed that PIN1 is negatively correlated with multiregional neurofibrillary tangle density and global cognitive function in females only. Additional analysis revealed a decrease in PIN1 in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared with aged individuals, again driven predominantly by female subjects. Histochemical analysis of PIN1 in AD and control male and female neocortex revealed an overall decrease in axonal PIN1 protein levels in females. These findings emphasize the importance of considering sex differences in AD research.	Aging; Alzheimer’s; Females; Gene expression; Mild Cognitive Impairment; PIN1; ROS/MAP

A comprehensive multi-omics analysis reveals unique signatures to predict Alzheimer's disease.	Complex disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), result from the combined influence of multiple biological and environmental factors. The integration of high-throughput data from multiple omics platforms can provide system overviews, improving our understanding of complex biological processes underlying human disease. In this study, integrated data from four omics platforms were used to characterise biological signatures of AD. The study cohort consists of 455 participants (Control:148, Cases:307) from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Genotype (SNP), methylation (CpG), RNA and proteomics data were collected, quality-controlled and pre-processed (SNP = 130; CpG = 83; RNA = 91; Proteomics = 119). Using a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)/AD combined as the target phenotype, we first used Partial Least Squares Regression as an unsupervised classification framework to assess the prediction capabilities for each omics dataset individually. We then used a variation of the sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis (sGCCA) to assess predictions of the combined datasets and identify multi-omics signatures characterising each group of participants. Analysing datasets individually we found methylation data provided the best predictions with an accuracy of 0.63 (95%CI = [0.54-0.71]), followed by RNA, 0.61 (95%CI = [0.52-0.69]), SNP, 0.59 (95%CI = [0.51-0.68]) and proteomics, 0.58 (95%CI = [0.51-0.67]). After integration of the four datasets, predictions were dramatically improved with a resulting accuracy of 0.95 (95% CI = [0.89-0.98]). The integration of data from multiple platforms is a powerful approach to explore biological systems and better characterise the biological signatures of AD. The results suggest that integrative methods can identify biomarker panels with improved predictive performance compared to individual platforms alone. Further validation in independent cohorts is required to validate and refine the results presented in this study.

PTPRS is a novel marker for early Tau pathology and synaptic integrity in Alzheimer's disease.	"We examined the role of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma (PTPRS) in the context of Alzheimer's disease and synaptic integrity. Publicly available datasets (BRAINEAC, ROSMAP, ADC1) and a cohort of asymptomatic but ""at risk"" individuals (PREVENT-AD) were used to explore the relationship between PTPRS and various Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. We identified that PTPRS rs10415488 variant C shows features of neuroprotection against early Tau pathology and synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. This single nucleotide polymorphism correlated with higher PTPRS transcript abundance and lower p(181)Tau and GAP-43 levels in the CSF. In the brain, PTPRS protein abundance was significantly correlated with the quantity of two markers of synaptic integrity: SNAP25 and SYT-1. We also found the presence of sexual dimorphism for PTPRS, with higher CSF concentrations in males than females. Male carriers for variant C were found to have a 10-month delay in the onset of AD.

APOE2 protects against Aβ pathology by improving neuronal mitochondrial function through ERRα signaling.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes (APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4) show different AD susceptibility. Previous studies indicated that individuals carrying the APOE2 allele reduce the risk of developing AD, which may be attributed to the potential neuroprotective role of APOE2. However, the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of APOE2 is still unclear. We analyzed single-nucleus RNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing data of APOE2 and APOE3 carriers from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort. We validated the findings in SH-SY5Y cells and AD model mice by evaluating mitochondrial functions and cognitive behaviors respectively. The pathway analysis of six major cell types revealed a strong association between APOE2 and cellular stress and energy metabolism, particularly in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which was found to be more pronounced in the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ). Moreover, APOE2 overexpression alleviates Aβ1-42-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and reduces the generation of reactive oxygen species in SH-SY5Y cells. These protective effects may be due to ApoE2 interacting with estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα). ERRα overexpression by plasmids or activation by agonist was also found to show similar mitochondrial protective effects in Aβ1-42-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, ERRα agonist treatment improve the cognitive performance of Aβ injected mice in both Y maze and novel object recognition tests. ERRα agonist treatment increased PSD95 expression in the cortex of agonist-treated-AD mice. APOE2 appears to enhance neural mitochondrial function via the activation of ERRα signaling, which may be the protective effect of APOE2 to treat AD.

Cell-type specific inference from bulk RNA-sequencing data by integrating single cell reference profiles via EPIC-unmix.	Cell type specific (CTS) analysis is essential to reveal biological insights obscured in bulk tissue data. However, single-cell (sc) or single-nuclei (sn) resolution data are still cost-prohibitive for large-scale samples. Thus, computational methods to perform deconvolution from bulk tissue data are highly valuable. We here present EPIC-unmix, a novel two-step empirical Bayesian method integrating reference sc/sn RNA-seq data and bulk RNA-seq data from target samples to enhance the accuracy of CTS inference. We demonstrate through comprehensive simulations across three tissues that EPIC-unmix achieved 4.6% - 109.8% higher accuracy compared to alternative methods. By applying EPIC-unmix to human bulk brain RNA-seq data from the ROSMAP and MSBB cohorts, we identified multiple genes differentially expressed between Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases versus controls in a CTS manner, including 57.4% novel genes not identified using similar sample size sc/snRNA-seq data, indicating the power of our

Cellular senescence induced by cholesterol accumulation is mediated by lysosomal ABCA1 in APOE4 and AD.	Cellular senescence is a hallmark of aging and has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cholesterol accumulation drives cellular senescence; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis. ABCA1 expression and its trafficking is afiltered in APOE4 and AD cellular and mouse models. However, whether ABCA1 trafficking is involved in cellular senescence in APOE4 and AD remains unknown. We examined the association between cellular senescence and ABCA1 expression in human postmortem brain samples using transcriptomic, histological, and biochemical analyses. An unbiased proteomic screening was performed to identify targets that mediate cellular ABCA1 trafficking. APOE4-TR mice, immortalized, primary and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models were used to examine the cholesterol-ABCA1-senescence pathways. Bulk and single nuclei transcriptomic profiling of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from the Religious Order Study/Memory Aging Project (ROSMAP) revealed upregulation of cellular senescence transcriptome signatures in AD, which was strongly correlated with ABCA1 expression. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analyses confirmed increased ABCA1 expression in AD brain tissues, which was associated with lipofuscin-stained lipids and mTOR phosphorylation. Using discovery proteomics, caveolin-1, a sensor of cellular cholesterol accumulation, was identified to promote ABCA1 endolysosomal trafficking. Greater caveolin-1 expression was found in both APOE4-TR mouse models and AD human brains. Cholesterol induced mTORC1 activation was regulated by ABCA1 expression or its lysosomal trapping. Reducing cholesterol by cyclodextrin in APOE4-TR mice reduced ABCA1 lysosome trapping and increased ABCA1 recycling to efflux cholesterol to HDL particles, reducing mTORC1 activation and senescence-associated neuroinflammation. In human iPSC-derived astrocytes, the reduction of cholesterol by cyclodextrin attenuated inflammatory responses. Cholesterol accumulation in APOE4 and AD induced caveolin-1 expression, which traps ABCA1 in lysosomes to activate mTORC1 pathways and induce cellular senescence. This study provided novel insights into how cholesterol accumulation in APOE4 and AD accelerates senescence.	ABCA1; Alzheimer’s disease; cholesterol; lysosome; senescence

"We examined the role of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma (PTPRS) in the context of Alzheimer's disease and synaptic integrity. Publicly available datasets (BRAINEAC, ROSMAP, ADC1) and a cohort of asymptomatic but ""at risk"" individuals (PREVENT-AD) were used to explore the relationship between PTPRS and various Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. We identified that PTPRS rs10415488 variant C shows features of neuroprotection against early tau pathology and synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. This single nucleotide polymorphism correlated with higher PTPRS transcript abundance and lower P-tau181 and GAP-43 levels in the CSF. In the brain, PTPRS protein abundance was significantly correlated with the quantity of two markers of synaptic integrity: SNAP25 and SYT-1. We also found the presence of sexual dimorphism for PTPRS, with higher CSF concentrations in males than females. Male carriers for variant C were found to have a 10-month delay in the onset of AD. We thus conclude that PTPRS acts as a neuroprotective receptor in Alzheimer's disease. Its protective effect is most important in males, in whom it postpones the age of onset of the disease."

We have developed the regional principal components (rPCs) method, a novel approach for summarizing gene-level methylation. rPCs address the challenge of deciphering complex epigenetic mechanisms in diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast to traditional averaging, rPCs leverage principal components analysis to capture complex methylation patterns across gene regions. Our method demonstrated a 54% improvement in sensitivity over averaging in simulations, offering a robust framework for identifying subtle epigenetic variations. Applying rPCs to the AD brain methylation data in ROSMAP, combined with cell type deconvolution, we uncovered 838 differentially methylated genes associated with neuritic plaque burden-significantly outperforming conventional methods.

Characterizing molecular and synaptic signatures in mouse models of late-onset Alzheimer's disease independent of amyloid and tau pathology.	MODEL-AD (Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease) is creating and distributing novel mouse models with humanized, clinically relevant genetic risk factors to capture the trajectory and progression of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) more accurately. We created the LOAD2 model by combining apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), Trem2*R47H, and humanized amyloid-beta (Aβ). Mice were subjected to a control diet or a high-fat/high-sugar diet (LOAD2+HFD). We assessed disease-relevant outcome measures in plasma and brain including neuroinflammation, Aβ, neurodegeneration, neuroimaging, and multi-omics. By 18 months, LOAD2+HFD mice exhibited sex-specific neuron loss, elevated insoluble brain Aβ42, increased plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), and altered gene/protein expression related to lipid metabolism and synaptic function. Imaging showed reductions in brain volume and neurovascular uncoupling. Deficits in acquiring touchscreen-based cognitive tasks were observed. The comprehensive characterization of LOAD2+HFD mice reveals that this model is important for preclinical studies seeking to understand disease trajectory and progression of LOAD prior to or independent of amyloid plaques and tau tangles. By 18 months, unlike control mice (e.g., LOAD2 mice fed a control diet, CD), LOAD2+HFD mice presented subtle but significant loss of neurons in the cortex, elevated levels of insoluble Ab42 in the brain, and increased plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL). Transcriptomics and proteomics showed changes in gene/proteins relating to a variety of disease-relevant processes including lipid metabolism and synaptic function. In vivo imaging revealed an age-dependent reduction in brain region volume (MRI) and neurovascular uncoupling (PET/CT). LOAD2+HFD mice also demonstrated deficits in acquisition of touchscreen-based cognitive tasks.

Deep Trans-Omic Network Fusion for Molecular Mechanism of Alzheimer's Disease.	There are various molecular hypotheses regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD) like amyloid deposition, tau propagation, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. However, detailed molecular mechanism underlying AD remains elusive. In addition, genetic contribution of these molecular hypothesis is not yet established despite the high heritability of AD. The study aims to enable the discovery of functionally connected multi-omic features through novel integration of multi-omic data and prior functional interactions. We propose a new deep learning model MoFNet with improved interpretability to investigate the AD molecular mechanism and its upstream genetic contributors. MoFNet integrates multi-omic data with prior functional interactions between SNPs, genes, and proteins, and for the first time models the dynamic information flow from DNA to RNA and proteins. When evaluated using the ROS/MAP cohort, MoFNet outperformed other competing methods in prediction performance. It identified SNPs, genes, and proteins with significantly more prior functional interactions, resulting in three multi-omic subnetworks. SNP-gene pairs identified by MoFNet were mostly eQTLs specific to frontal cortex tissue where gene/protein data was collected. These molecular subnetworks are enriched in innate immune system, clearance of misfolded proteins, and neurotransmitter release respectively. We validated most findings in an independent dataset. One multi-omic subnetwork consists exclusively of core members of SNARE complex, a key mediator of synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter transportation. Our results suggest that MoFNet is effective in improving classification accuracy and in identifying multi-omic markers for AD with improved interpretability. Multi-omic subnetworks identified by MoFNet provided insights of AD molecular mechanism with improved details.	Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; multi-omics; neural network; systems biology

Metabolic phenotyping reveals an emerging role of ammonia abnormality in Alzheimer's disease.	The metabolic implications in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a metabolomics study on a moderately aging Chinese Han cohort (n = 1397; mean age 66 years). Conjugated bile acids, branch-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and glutamate-related features exhibited strong correlations with cognitive impairment, clinical stage, and brain amyloid-β deposition (n = 421). These features demonstrated synergistic performances across clinical stages and subpopulations and enhanced the differentiation of AD stages beyond demographics and Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE-ε4). We validated their performances in eight data sets (total n = 7685) obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Importantly, identified features are linked to blood ammonia homeostasis. We further confirmed the elevated ammonia level through AD development (n = 1060). Our findings highlight AD as a metabolic disease and emphasize the metabolite-mediated ammonia disturbance in AD and its potential as a signature and therapeutic target for AD.

The underlying pathogenesis of anxiety remain elusive, making the pinpointing of potential therapeutic and diagnostic biomarkers for anxiety paramount to its efficient treatment. We undertook a proteome-wide association study (PWAS), fusing human brain proteomes from both discovery (ROS/MAP; N = 376) and validation cohorts (Banner; N = 152) with anxiety genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. Complementing this, we executed transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) leveraging human brain transcriptomic data from the Common Mind Consortium (CMC) to discern the confluence of genetic influences spanning both proteomic and transcriptomic levels. We further scrutinized significant genes through a suite of methodologies. We discerned 14 genes instrumental in the genesis of anxiety through their specific cis-regulated brain protein abundance. Out of these, 6 were corroborated in the confirmatory PWAS, with 4 also showing associations with anxiety via their cis-regulated brain mRNA levels. A heightened confidence level was attributed to 5 genes (RAB27B, CCDC92, BTN2A1, TMEM106B, and DOC2A), taking into account corroborative evidence from both the confirmatory PWAS and TWAS, coupled with insights from mendelian randomization analysis and colocalization evaluations. A majority of the identified genes manifest in brain regions intricately linked to anxiety and predominantly partake in lysosomal metabolic processes. The limited scope of the brain proteome reference datasets, stemming from a relatively modest sample size, potentially curtails our grasp on the entire gamut of genetic effects. The genes pinpointed in our research present a promising groundwork for crafting therapeutic interventions and diagnostic tools for anxiety.

HyperTMO: a trusted multi-omics integration framework based on hypergraph convolutional network for patient classification.	The rapid development of high-throughput biomedical technologies can provide researchers with detailed multi-omics data. The multi-omics integrated analysis approach based on machine learning contributes a more comprehensive perspective to human disease research. However, there are still significant challenges in representing single-omics data and integrating multi-omics information. This article presents HyperTMO, a Trusted Multi-Omics integration framework based on Hypergraph convolutional network for patient classification. HyperTMO constructs hypergraph structures to represent the association between samples in single-omics data, then evidence extraction is performed by hypergraph convolutional network, and multi-omics information is integrated at an evidence level. Last, we experimentally demonstrate that HyperTMO outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtype classification and Alzheimer's disease classification tasks using multi-omics data from TCGA (BRCA) and ROSMAP datasets. Importantly, HyperTMO is the first attempt to integrate hypergraph structure, evidence theory, and multi-omics integration for patient classification. Its accurate and robust properties bring great potential for applications in clinical diagnosis. HyperTMO and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/ippousyuga/HyperTMO.

Integrating multi-omics data is emerging as a critical approach in enhancing our understanding of complex diseases. Innovative computational methods capable of managing high-dimensional and heterogeneous datasets are required to unlock the full potential of such rich and diverse data. We propose a Multi-Omics integration framework with auxiliary Classifiers-enhanced AuToencoders (MOCAT) to utilize intra- and inter-omics information comprehensively. Additionally, attention mechanisms with confidence learning are incorporated for enhanced feature representation and trustworthy prediction. Extensive experiments were conducted on four benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, including BRCA, ROSMAP, LGG, and KIPAN. Our model significantly improved most evaluation measurements and consistently surpassed the state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies showed that the auxiliary classifiers significantly boosted classification accuracy in the ROSMAP and LGG datasets. Moreover, the attention mechanisms and confidence evaluation block contributed to improvements in the predictive accuracy and generalizability of our model. The proposed framework exhibits superior performance in disease classification and biomarker discovery, establishing itself as a robust and versatile tool for analyzing multi-layer biological data. This study highlights the significance of elaborated designed deep learning methodologies in dissecting complex disease phenotypes and improving the accuracy of disease predictions.

High throughput RNA sequencing brings new perspective to the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of diseases. Normalization is the first and most important step for RNA-Seq data, and it can differ based on the purpose of the analysis. Within-sample normalization methods (eg. TPM) are preferred when genes in a sample are compared with each other, and between-sample normalization methods (eg. deseq2, TMM, Voom) are used when the samples in a dataset are compared. Normalization approaches rescale the data, and, therefore, they affect the results of the analysis. Here, we selected two most commonly used Alzheimer's disease RNA-Seq datasets from ROSMAP and Mayo Clinic cohorts and mapped the differentially expressed genes on human protein interactome to discover disease-specific subnetworks. To this end, the raw count data were first processed with four different, commonly used RNA-Seq normalization methods (deseq2, TMM, Voom and TPM). Then, covariate adjustment was applied to the normalized data for gender, age of death and post-mortem interval. Each normalized dataset was separately mapped on the human protein-protein interaction network either in covariate-adjusted or non-adjusted form. Capturing known Alzheimer's disease genes and genes associated with the disease-related functional terms in the discovered subnetworks were the criteria to compare different normalization methods. Based on our results, applying covariate adjustment has a positive effect on normalization by removing the confounder effects. Covariate-adjusted TMM and covariate-adjusted deseq2 methods performed better in both transcriptome datasets.

CHRNA5 links chandelier cells to severity of amyloid pathology in aging and Alzheimer's disease.	Changes in high-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are intricately connected to neuropathology in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Protective and cognitive-enhancing roles for the nicotinic α5 subunit have been identified, but this gene has not been closely examined in the context of human aging and dementia. Therefore, we investigate the nicotinic α5 gene CHRNA5 and the impact of relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in prefrontal cortex from 922 individuals with matched genotypic and post-mortem RNA sequencing in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP). We find that a genotype robustly linked to increased expression of CHRNA5 (rs1979905A2) predicts significantly reduced cortical β-amyloid load. Intriguingly, co-expression analysis suggests CHRNA5 has a distinct cellular expression profile compared to other nicotinic receptor genes. Consistent with this prediction, single nucleus RNA sequencing from 22 individuals reveals CHRNA5 expression is disproportionately elevated in chandelier neurons, a distinct subtype of inhibitory neuron known for its role in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. We show that chandelier neurons are enriched in amyloid-binding proteins compared to basket cells, the other major subtype of PVALB-positive interneurons. Consistent with the hypothesis that nicotinic receptors in chandelier cells normally protect against β-amyloid, cell-type proportion analysis from 549 individuals reveals these neurons show amyloid-associated vulnerability only in individuals with impaired function/trafficking of nicotinic α5-containing receptors due to homozygosity of the missense CHRNA5 SNP (rs16969968A2). Taken together, these findings suggest that CHRNA5 and its nicotinic α5 subunit exert a neuroprotective role in aging and Alzheimer's disease centered on chandelier interneurons.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent and costly age-related dementia. Heritable factors account for 58-79% of variation in late-onset AD, but substantial variation remains in age-of- onset, disease severity, and whether those with high-risk genotypes acquire AD. To emulate the diversity of human populations, we utilized the AD-BXD mouse panel. This genetically diverse resource combines AD genotypes with multiple BXD strains to discover new genetic drivers of AD resilience. Comparing AD-BXD carriers to noncarrier littermates, we computed a novel quantitative metric for resilience to cognitive decline in the AD-BXDs. Our quantitative AD resilience trait was heritable and genetic mapping identified a locus on chr8 associated with resilience to AD mutations that resulted in amyloid brain pathology. Using a hippocampus proteomics dataset, we nominated the mitochondrial glutathione S reductase protein (GR or GSHR) as a resilience factor, finding that the DBA/2J genotype was associated with substantially higher GR abundance. By mapping protein QTLs (pQTLs), we identified synaptic organization and mitochondrial proteins coregulated in trans with a cis-pQTL for GR. We found four coexpression modules correlated with the quantitative resilience score in aged 5XFAD mice using paracliques, which were related to cell structure, protein folding, and postsynaptic densities. Finally, we found significant positive associations between human

Alzheimer's dementia (AD) pathogenesis involves complex mechanisms, including microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. Integrative network and machine learning analysis of miRNA can provide insights into AD pathology and prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers. We performed co-expression network analysis to identify network modules associated with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition using brain tissue miRNA profiles from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) (N = 702) as a discovery dataset. We performed association analysis of hub miRNAs with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition. After selecting target genes of the hub miRNAs, we performed association analysis of the hub miRNAs with their target genes and then performed pathway-based enrichment analysis. For replication, we performed a consensus miRNA co-expression network analysis using the ROS/MAP dataset and an independent dataset (N = 16) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Furthermore, we performed a machine learning approach to assess the performance of hub miRNAs for AD classification. Network analysis identified a glucose metabolism pathway-enriched module (M3) as significantly associated with AD and cognition. Five hub miRNAs (miR-129-5p, miR-433, miR-1260, miR-200a, and miR-221) of M3 had significant associations with AD clinical and/or pathologic traits, with miR129-5p by far the strongest across all phenotypes. Gene-set enrichment analysis of target genes associated with their corresponding hub miRNAs identified significantly enriched biological pathways including ErbB, AMPK, MAPK, and mTOR signaling pathways. Consensus network analysis identified two AD-associated consensus network modules and two hub miRNAs (miR-129-5p and miR-221). Machine learning analysis showed that the AD classification performance (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.807) of age, sex, and APOE ε4 carrier status was significantly improved by 6.3% with inclusion of five AD-associated hub miRNAs. Integrative network and machine learning analysis identified miRNA signatures, especially miR-129-5p, as associated with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition, enhancing our understanding of AD pathogenesis and leading to better performance of AD classification as potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers.

Human disease-specific cell signatures in non-lesional tissue in Multiple Sclerosis detected by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.	"Recent investigations of cell type changes in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using single-cell profiling methods have focused on active lesional and peri-lesional brain tissue, and have implicated a number of peripheral and central nervous system cell types. However, an important question is the extent to which so-called ""normal-appearing"" non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age- and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified region- and cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter. To validate our findings, we generated Visium spatial transcriptomics data on matched tissue from 13 donors, and recapitulated our observations of gene expression differences in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Finally, we show that some of the differences observed between control and MS donors in NAWM mirror those previously reported between control WM and active lesions in MS donors. Overall, our investigation sheds additional light on cell type- and disease-specific differences present even in non-lesional white and grey matter tissue, highlighting widespread cellular signatures that may be associated with downstream pathological changes."

Identification of female-enriched and disease-associated microglia (FDAMic) contributes to sexual dimorphism in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.	Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common form of dementia; it disproportionally affects women in terms of both incidence rates and severity of progression. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this clinical phenomenon remain elusive and ill-defined. In-depth analyses were performed with multiple human LOAD single-nucleus transcriptome datasets to thoroughly characterize cell populations in the cerebral cortex. ROSMAP bulk human brain tissue transcriptome and DNA methylome datasets were also included for validation. Detailed assessments of microglial cell subpopulations and their relevance to sex-biased changes at the tissue level were performed. Clinical trait associations, cell evolutionary trajectories, and transcription regulon analyses were conducted. The relative numbers of functionally defective microglia were aberrantly increased uniquely among affected females. Substratification of the microglia into different subtypes according to their transcriptomic signatures identified a group of female-enriched and disease-associated microglia (FDAMic), the numbers of which were positively associated with disease severity. Phenotypically, these cells exhibit transcriptomic signatures that support active proliferation, MHC class II autoantigen presentation and amyloid-β binding, but they are also likely defective in phagocytosis. FDAMic are likely evolved from female activated response microglia (ARMic) with an APOE4 background and compromised estrogen receptor (ER) signaling that is deemed to be active among most subtypes of microglia. This study offered important insights at both the cellular and molecular levels into how ER signaling affects microglial heterogeneity and function. FDAMic are associated with more advanced pathologies and severe trends of cognitive decline. Their emergence could, at least in part, explain the phenomenon of greater penetrance of the APOE4 genotype found in females. The biases of FDAMic emergence toward female sex and APOE4 status may also explain why hormone replacement therapy is more effective in APOE4 carriers. The pathologic nature of FDAMic suggests that selective modulations of these cells may help to regain brain neuroimmune homeostasis, serving as a new target for future drug development.

Statistical Inference of Cell-type Proportions Estimated from Bulk Expression Data.	There is a growing interest in cell-type-specific analysis from bulk samples with a mixture of different cell types. A critical first step in such analyses is the accurate estimation of cell-type proportions in a bulk sample. Although many methods have been proposed recently, quantifying the uncertainties associated with the estimated cell-type proportions has not been well studied. Lack of consideration of these uncertainties can lead to missed or false findings in downstream analyses. In this article, we introduce a flexible statistical deconvolution framework that allows a general and subject-specific covariance of bulk gene expressions. Under this framework, we propose a decorrelated constrained least squares method called DECALS that estimates cell-type proportions as well as the sampling distribution of the estimates. Simulation studies demonstrate that DECALS can accurately quantify the uncertainties in the estimated proportions whereas other methods fail. Applying DECALS to analyze bulk gene expression data of post mortem brain samples from the ROSMAP and GTEx projects, we show that taking into account the uncertainties in the estimated cell-type proportions can lead to more accurate identifications of cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes and transcripts between different subject groups, such as between Alzheimer's disease patients and controls and between males and females.	cell type deconvolution; cell-type proportions; cell-type-specific analysis; decorrelation; uncertainty quantification

Learning from vertically distributed data across multiple sites: An efficient privacy-preserving algorithm for Cox proportional hazards model with variable selection.	To develop a lossless distributed algorithm for regularized Cox proportional hazards model with variable selection to support federated learning for vertically distributed data. We propose a novel distributed algorithm for fitting regularized Cox proportional hazards model when data sharing among different data providers is restricted. Based on cyclical coordinate descent, the proposed algorithm computes intermediary statistics by each site and then exchanges them to update the model parameters in other sites without accessing individual patient-level data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm with (1) a simulation study and (2) a real-world data analysis predicting the risk of Alzheimer's dementia from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Moreover, we compared the performance of our method with existing privacy-preserving models. Our algorithm achieves privacy-preserving variable selection for time-to-event data in the vertically distributed setting, without degradation of accuracy compared with a centralized approach. Simulation demonstrates that our algorithm is highly efficient in analyzing high-dimensional datasets. Real-world data analysis reveals that our distributed Cox model yields higher accuracy in predicting the risk of Alzheimer's dementia than the conventional Cox model built by each data provider without data sharing. Moreover, our algorithm is computationally more efficient compared with existing privacy-preserving Cox models with or without regularization term. The proposed algorithm is lossless, privacy-preserving and highly efficient to fit regularized Cox model for vertically distributed data. It provides a suitable and convenient approach for modeling time-to-event data in a distributed manner.

Depression, a common psychiatric illness and global public health problem, remains poorly understood across different life stages, which hampers the development of novel treatments. To identify new candidate genes for therapeutic development, we performed differential gene expression analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of older adults (n = 424) in relation to antemortem depressive symptoms. Additionally, we integrated genome-wide association study results for depression (n = 500,199) along with genetic tools for inferring the expression of 14,048 unique genes in 7 cell types and 52 cell subtypes to perform a transcriptome-wide association study of depression followed by Mendelian randomization. Our single-nucleus transcriptome-wide association study analysis identified 68 candidate genes for depression and showed the greatest number being in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Of the 68 genes, 53 were novel compared to previous studies. Notably, gene expression in different neuronal subtypes had varying effects on depression risk. Traits with high genetic correlations with depression, such as neuroticism, shared more transcriptome-wide association study genes than traits that were not highly correlated with depression. Complementing these analyses, differential gene expression analysis across 52 neocortical cell subtypes showed that genes such as KCNN2, SCAI, WASF3, and SOCS6 were associated with late-life depressive symptoms in specific cell subtypes. These 2 sets of analyses illustrate the utility of large single-nucleus RNA sequencing data both to uncover genes whose expression is altered in specific cell subtypes in the context of depressive symptoms and to enhance the interpretation of well-powered genome-wide association studies so that we can prioritize specific susceptibility genes for further analysis and therapeutic development.

Effects of copy number variations on longevity in late-onset Alzheimer's disease patients: insights from a causality network analysis.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), is a prevalent form of dementia that significantly affects patients' cognitive and behavioral capacities and longevity. Although approximately 70 genetic risk factors linked with AD have been identified, their influence on patient longevity remains unclear. Further, recent studies have associated copy number variations (CNVs) with the longevity of healthy individuals and immune-related pathways in AD patients. This study aims to investigate the role of CNVs on the longevity of AD patients by integrating the Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and transcriptomics data from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort through causality network inference. Our comprehensive analysis led to the construction of a CNV-Gene-Age of Death (AOD) causality network. We successfully identified three key CNVs (DEL5006, mCNV14192, and DUP42180) and seven AD-longevity causal genes (	Alzheimer’s disease; causality network; copy number variation; longevity; plasminogen activation

We identified female-specific elevation in glycerophosphorylcholine and N-acetylglutamate, which are AD inflammatory metabolites involved in interleukin (IL)-17 signaling, C-type lectin receptor, interferon signaling, and Toll-like receptor pathways. We pinpointed distinct microglia-specific immunometabolism endophenotypes (i.e., lipid- and amino acid-specific IL-10 and IL-17 signaling pathways) between female and male AD subjects. In addition, female AD subjects showed evidence of diminished excitatory neuron and microglia communications via glutamate-mediated immunometabolism. Our results point to new understanding of the molecular basis for female predominance in AD, and warrant future independent validations with ethnically diverse patient cohorts to establish a likely causal relationship of microglial immunometabolism in the sex differences in AD. Sex-specific immune metabolites, gene networks and pathways, are associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and disease progression. Female AD subjects exhibit microglial immunometabolism endophenotypes characterized by decreased glutamate metabolism and elevated interleukin-10 pathway activity. Female AD subjects showed a shift in glutamate-mediated cell-cell communications between excitatory neurons to microglia and astrocyte."

Integrative multi-omics analysis reveals the critical role of the PBXIP1 gene in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and its strongest risk factor is aging. A few studies have explored the relationship between aging and AD, while the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We assembled data across multi-omics (i.e., epigenetics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, based on frozen tissues from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and neuropathological and clinical traits from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Aging was assessed using six DNA methylation clocks (including the Horvath clock, Hannum clock, Levine clock, HorvathSkin clock, Lin clock, and Cortical clock) that capture mortality risk in literature. After accounting for age, we first identified a gene module (including 263 genes) that was related to the integrated aging measure of six clocks, as well as three neuropathological traits of AD (i.e., β-amyloid, Tau tangles, and tangle density). Interestingly, among 20 key genes with top intramodular connectivity of the module, PBXIP1 was the only one that was significantly associated with all three neuropathological traits of AD at the protein level after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, PBXIP1 was associated with the clinical diagnosis of AD in both ROSMAP and three independent datasets. Moreover, PBXIP1 may be related to AD through its role in astrocytes and hippocampal neurons, and the mTOR pathway. The results suggest the critical role of PBXIP1 in AD and support the potential and feasibility of using multi-omics data to investigate mechanisms of complex diseases. However, more validations in different populations and experiments in vitro and in vivo are required in the future.

Alzheimer's dementia (AD) pathogenesis involves complex mechanisms, including microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. Integrative network and machine learning analysis of miRNA can provide insights into AD pathology and prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers. We performed co-expression network analysis to identify network modules associated with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition using brain tissue miRNA profiles from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) (N = 702) as a discovery dataset. We performed association analysis of hub miRNAs with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition. After selecting target genes of the hub miRNAs, we performed association analysis of the hub miRNAs with their target genes and then performed pathway-based enrichment analysis. For replication, we performed a consensus miRNA co-expression network analysis using the ROS/MAP dataset and an independent dataset (N = 16) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Furthermore, we performed a machine learning approach to assess the performance of hub miRNAs for AD classification. Network analysis identified a glucose metabolism pathway-enriched module (M3) as significantly associated with AD and cognition. Five hub miRNAs (miR-129-5p, miR-433, miR-1260, miR-200a, and miR-221) of M3 had significant associations with AD clinical and/or pathologic traits, with miR129-5p by far the strongest across all phenotypes. Gene-set enrichment analysis of target genes associated with their corresponding hub miRNAs identified significantly enriched biological pathways including ErbB, AMPK, MAPK, and mTOR signaling pathways. Consensus network analysis identified two AD-associated consensus network modules, and two hub miRNAs (miR-129-5p and miR-221). Machine learning analysis showed that the AD classification performance (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.807) of age, sex, and Integrative network and machine learning analysis identified miRNA signatures, especially miR-129-5p, as associated with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition, enhancing our understanding of AD pathogenesis and leading to better performance of AD classification as potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers.

Explainable variational autoencoder (E-VAE) model using genome-wide SNPs to predict dementia.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD related dementias (ADRD) are complex multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases. The associations between genetic variants obtained from genome wide association studies (GWAS) are the most widely available and well documented variants associated with ADRD. Application of deep learning methods to analyze large scale GWAS data may be a powerful approach to elucidate the biological mechanisms in ADRD compared to penalized regression models that may lead to over-fitting. We developed a deep learning frame work explainable variational autoencoder (E-VAE) classifier model using genotype (GWAS SNPs = 5474) data from 2714 study participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to classify ADRD. We validated the generalizability of this model among 234 participants in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Utilizing a linear decoder approach we have extracted the weights associated with latent features for biological interpretation. We obtained a predictive accuracy of 0.71 (95 % CI [0.59, 0.84]) with an AUC of 0.69 in the HRS test dataset and got an accuracy of 0.62 (95 % CI [0.56, 0.68]) with an AUC of 0.63 in the ROSMAP dataset. This is the first study showing the generalizability of a deep learning prediction model for dementia using genetic variants in an independent cohort. The latent features identified using E-VAE can help us understand the biology of AD/ ADRD and better characterize disease status.	Deep learning; Dementia; GWAS SNPs; Generalizable; Prediction model

Multi-tissue epigenetic analysis identifies distinct associations underlying insulin resistance and Alzheimer's disease at CPT1A locus.	Insulin resistance (IR) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The mechanisms by which IR predisposes to AD are not well-understood. Epigenetic studies may help identify molecular signatures of IR associated with AD, thus improving our understanding of the biological and regulatory mechanisms linking IR and AD. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of IR, quantified using the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and adjusted for body mass index, in 3,167 participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) without type 2 diabetes at the time of blood draw used for methylation measurement. We identified DNA methylation markers associated with IR at the genome-wide level accounting for multiple testing (P < 1.1 × 10 We confirmed the strong association of blood DNA methylation with IR at three loci (cg17901584-DHCR24, cg17058475-CPT1A, cg00574958-CPT1A, and cg06500161-ABCG1). In FHS, higher levels of blood DNA methylation at cg00574958 and cg17058475 were both associated with lower IR (P = 2.4 × 10 Our results suggest potentially distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanisms between peripheral blood and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues underlying IR and AD at CPT1A locus.

The impact of blood MCP-1 levels on Alzheimer's disease with genetic variation of UNC5C and NAV3 loci.	Previous study shows that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which is implicated in the peripheral proinflammatory cascade and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, modulates the genetic risks of AD in established AD loci. In this study, we hypothesized that blood MCP-1 impacts the AD risk of genetic variants beyond known AD loci. We thus performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the logistic regression via generalized estimating equations (GEE) and the Cox proportional-hazards models to examine the interactive effects between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and blood MCP-1 level on AD in three cohorts: the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP).

Associations of cortical SPP1 and ITGAX with cognition and common neuropathologies in older adults.	The secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) gene expressed by CD11c We leveraged protein measurements, single-nuclei, and RNASeq data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) of over 1200 samples for association analysis. Expression of SPP1 and its encoded protein osteopontin were associated with faster cognitive decline and greater odds of common neuropathologies. At single-cell resolution, integrin subunit alpha X (ITGAX) was highly expressed in microglia, where specific subpopulations were associated with AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The study provides evidence of SPP1 and ITGAX association with cognitive decline and common neuropathologies identifying a microglial subset associated with disease.

Decreased CNNM2 expression in prefrontal cortex affects sensorimotor gating function, cognition, dendritic spine morphogenesis and risk of schizophrenia.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reported multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with schizophrenia, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify schizophrenia relevant genes showing alterations in mRNA and protein expression associated with risk SNPs at the 10q24.32-33 GWAS locus. We carried out the quantitative trait loci (QTL) and summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analyses, using the PsychENCODE dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) expression QTL (eQTL) database, as well as the ROSMAP and Banner DLPFC protein QTL (pQTL) datasets. The gene CNNM2 (encoding a magnesium transporter) at 10q24.32-33 was identified to be a robust schizophrenia risk gene, and was highly expressed in human neurons according to single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. We further revealed that reduced Cnnm2 in the mPFC of mice led to impaired cognition and compromised sensorimotor gating function, and decreased Cnnm2 in primary cortical neurons altered dendritic spine morphogenesis, confirming the link between CNNM2 and endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Proteomics analyses showed that reduced Cnnm2 level changed expression of proteins associated with neuronal structure and function. Together, these results identify a robust gene in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

Abnormal Brain Protein Abundance and Cross-tissue mRNA Expression in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.	Due to the limitations of the present risk genes in understanding the etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), it is necessary to find additional causative genes utilizing novel approaches. In this study, we conducted a two-stage proteome-wide association study (PWAS) using ALS genome-wide association study (GWAS) data (N = 152,268) and two distinct human brain protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) datasets (ROSMAP N = 376 and Banner N = 152) to identify ALS risk genes and prioritized candidate genes with Mendelian randomization (MR) and Bayesian colocalization analysis. Next, we verified the aberrant expression of risk genes in multiple tissues, including lower motor neurons, skeletal muscle, and whole blood. Six ALS risk genes (SCFD1, SARM1, TMEM175, BCS1L, WIPI2, and DHRS11) were found during the PWAS discovery phase, and SARM1 and BCS1L were confirmed during the validation phase.

Neuronal actin cytoskeleton gain of function in the human brain.	While advancements in imaging techniques have led to major strides in deciphering the human brain, successful interventions are elusive and represent some of the most persistent translational gaps in medicine. Human restricted CHRFAM7A has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. The physiological role of CHRFAM7A in human brain is explored using multiomics approach on 600 post mortem human brain tissue samples. The emerging pathways and mechanistic hypotheses are tested and validated in an isogenic hiPSC model of CHRFAM7A knock-in medial ganglionic eminence progenitors and neurons. CHRFAM7A is identified as a modulator of intracellular calcium dynamics and an upstream regulator of Rac1. Rac1 activation re-designs the actin cytoskeleton leading to dynamic actin driven remodeling of membrane protrusion and a switch from filopodia to lamellipodia. The reinforced cytoskeleton leads to an advantage to tolerate stiffer mechanical properties of the extracellular environment. CHRFAM7A modifies the actin cytoskeleton to a more dynamic and stiffness resistant state in an α7nAChR dependent manner. CHRFAM7A may facilitate neuronal adaptation to changes in the brain environment in physiological and pathological conditions contributing to risk or recovery. Understanding how CHRFAM7A affects human brain requires human studies in the areas of memory formation and erasure, cognitive reserve, and neuronal plasticity.

A data-driven study of Alzheimer's disease related amyloid and tau pathology progression.	Amyloid-β is thought to facilitate the spread of tau throughout the neocortex in Alzheimer's disease, though how this occurs is not well understood. This is because of the spatial discordance between amyloid-β, which accumulates in the neocortex, and tau, which accumulates in the medial temporal lobe during ageing. There is evidence that in some cases amyloid-β-independent tau spreads beyond the medial temporal lobe where it may interact with neocortical amyloid-β. This suggests that there may be multiple distinct spatiotemporal subtypes of Alzheimer's-related protein aggregation, with potentially different demographic and genetic risk profiles. We investigated this hypothesis, applying data-driven disease progression subtyping models to post-mortem neuropathology and in vivo PET-based measures from two large observational studies: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). We consistently identified 'amyloid-first' and 'tau-first' subtypes using cross-sectional information from both studies. In the amyloid-first subtype, extensive neocortical amyloid-β precedes the spread of tau beyond the medial temporal lobe, while in the tau-first subtype, mild tau accumulates in medial temporal and neocortical areas prior to interacting with amyloid-β. As expected, we found a higher prevalence of the amyloid-first subtype among apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele carriers while the tau-first subtype was more common among APOE ε4 non-carriers. Within tau-first APOE ε4 carriers, we found an increased rate of amyloid-β accumulation (via longitudinal amyloid PET), suggesting that this rare group may belong within the Alzheimer's disease continuum. We also found that tau-first APOE ε4 carriers had several fewer years of education than other groups, suggesting a role for modifiable risk factors in facilitating amyloid-β-independent tau. Tau-first APOE ε4 non-carriers, in contrast, recapitulated many of the features of primary age-related tauopathy. The rate of longitudinal amyloid-β and tau accumulation (both measured via PET) within this group did not differ from normal ageing, supporting the distinction of primary age-related tauopathy from Alzheimer's disease. We also found reduced longitudinal subtype consistency within tau-first APOE ε4 non-carriers, suggesting additional heterogeneity within this group. Our findings support the idea that amyloid-β and tau may begin as independent processes in spatially disconnected regions, with widespread neocortical tau resulting from the local interaction of amyloid-β and tau. The site of this interaction may be subtype-dependent: medial temporal lobe in amyloid-first, neocortex in tau-first. These insights into the dynamics of amyloid-β and tau may inform research and clinical trials that target these pathologies.

Pooled analysis of frontal lobe transcriptomic data identifies key mitophagy gene changes in Alzheimer's disease brain.	The growing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming a global health challenge without effective treatments. Defective mitochondrial function and mitophagy have recently been suggested as etiological factors in AD, in association with abnormalities in components of the autophagic machinery like lysosomes and phagosomes. Several large transcriptomic studies have been performed on different brain regions from AD and healthy patients, and their data represent a vast source of important information that can be utilized to understand this condition. However, large integration analyses of these publicly available data, such as AD RNA-Seq data, are still missing. In addition, large-scale focused analysis on mitophagy, which seems to be relevant for the aetiology of the disease, has not yet been performed. In this study, publicly available raw RNA-Seq data generated from healthy control and sporadic AD post-mortem human samples of the brain frontal lobe were collected and integrated. Sex-specific differential expression analysis was performed on the combined data set after batch effect correction. From the resulting set of differentially expressed genes, candidate mitophagy-related genes were identified based on their known functional roles in mitophagy, the lysosome, or the phagosome, followed by Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) and microRNA-mRNA network analysis. The expression changes of candidate genes were further validated in human skin fibroblast and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived cortical neurons from AD patients and matching healthy controls. From a large dataset (AD: 589; control: 246) based on three different datasets (i.e., ROSMAP, MSBB, & GSE110731), we identified 299 candidate mitophagy-related differentially expressed genes (DEG) in sporadic AD patients (male: 195, female: 188). Among these, the AAA ATPase VCP, the GTPase ARF1, the autophagic vesicle forming protein GABARAPL1 and the cytoskeleton protein actin beta ACTB were selected based on network degrees and existing literature. Changes in their expression were further validated in AD-relevant human Through the joint analysis of multiple publicly available data sets, we identify four differentially expressed key mitophagy-related genes potentially relevant for the pathogenesis of sporadic AD. Changes in expression of these four genes were validated using two AD-relevant human	ARF1; Alzheimer's disease; GABARAPL1; VCP; lysosome; mitochondria; mitophagy; transcriptomics

A genome-wide search for pleiotropy in more than 100,000 harmonized longitudinal cognitive domain scores.	More than 75 common variant loci account for only a portion of the heritability for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A more complete understanding of the genetic basis of AD can be deduced by exploring associations with AD-related endophenotypes. We conducted genome-wide scans for cognitive domain performance using harmonized and co-calibrated scores derived by confirmatory factor analyses for executive function, language, and memory. We analyzed 103,796 longitudinal observations from 23,066 members of community-based (FHS, ACT, and ROSMAP) and clinic-based (ADRCs and ADNI) cohorts using generalized linear mixed models including terms for SNP, age, SNP × age interaction, sex, education, and five ancestry principal components. Significance was determined based on a joint test of the SNP's main effect and interaction with age. Results across datasets were combined using inverse-variance meta-analysis. Genome-wide tests of pleiotropy for each domain pair as the outcome were performed using PLACO software. Individual domain and pleiotropy analyses revealed genome-wide significant (GWS) associations with five established loci for AD and AD-related disorders (BIN1, CR1, GRN, MS4A6A, and APOE) and eight novel loci. ULK2 was associated with executive function in the community-based cohorts (rs157405, P = 2.19 × 10 Our results provide some insight into biological pathways underlying processes leading to domain-specific cognitive impairment and AD, as well as a conduit toward a syndrome-specific precision medicine approach to AD. Increasing the number of participants with harmonized cognitive domain scores will enhance the discovery of additional genetic factors of cognitive decline leading to AD and related dementias.

Sex specific molecular networks and key drivers of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and age-associated neurodegenerative disorder that affects women disproportionally. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly characterized. Moreover, while the interplay between sex and ApoE genotype in AD has been investigated, multi-omics studies to understand this interaction are limited. Therefore, we applied systems biology approaches to investigate sex-specific molecular networks of AD. We integrated large-scale human postmortem brain transcriptomic data of AD from two cohorts (MSBB and ROSMAP) via multiscale network analysis and identified key drivers with sexually dimorphic expression patterns and/or different responses to APOE genotypes between sexes. The expression patterns and functional relevance of the top sex-specific network driver of AD were further investigated using postmortem human brain samples and gene perturbation experiments in AD mouse models. Gene expression changes in AD versus control were identified for each sex. Gene co-expression networks were constructed for each sex to identify AD-associated co-expressed gene modules shared by males and females or specific to each sex. Key network regulators were further identified as potential drivers of sex differences in AD development. LRP10 was identified as a top driver of the sex differences in AD pathogenesis and manifestation. Changes of LRP10 expression at the mRNA and protein levels were further validated in human AD brain samples. Gene perturbation experiments in EFAD mouse models demonstrated that LRP10 differentially affected cognitive function and AD pathology in sex- and APOE genotype-specific manners. A comprehensive mapping of brain cells in LRP10 over-expressed (OE) female E4FAD mice suggested neurons and microglia as the most affected cell populations. The female-specific targets of LRP10 identified from the single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of the LRP10 OE E4FAD mouse brains were significantly enriched in the LRP10-centered subnetworks in female AD subjects, validating LRP10 as a key network regulator of AD in females. Eight LRP10 binding partners were identified by the yeast two-hybrid system screening, and LRP10 over-expression reduced the association of LRP10 with one binding partner CD34. These findings provide insights into key mechanisms mediating sex differences in AD pathogenesis and will facilitate the development of sex- and APOE genotype-specific therapies for AD.

The fusiform gyrus exhibits differential gene-gene co-expression in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by the presence of β-amyloid plaques and tau deposits in various regions of the brain. However, the underlying factors that contribute to the development of AD remain unclear. Recently, the fusiform gyrus has been identified as a critical brain region associated with mild cognitive impairment, which may increase the risk of AD development. In our study, we performed gene co-expression and differential co-expression network analyses, as well as gene-expression-based prediction, using RNA-seq transcriptome data from post-mortem fusiform gyrus tissue samples collected from both cognitively healthy individuals and those with AD. We accessed differential co-expression networks in large cohorts such as ROSMAP, MSBB, and Mayo, and conducted over-representation analyses of gene pathways and gene ontology. Our results comprise four exclusive gene hubs in co-expression modules of Alzheimer's Disease, including	Alzheimer's disease; brain tissue; co-expression networks; differential co-expression networks; fusiform gyrus; hub genes; regulatory networks

Identifying genetic variants for amyloid β in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment.	The genetic basis of amyloid β (Aβ) deposition in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) is still unknown. Here, we investigated genetic variants involved in Aβ deposition in patients with SVCI. We recruited a total of 110 patients with SVCI and 424 patients with Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive impairment (ADCI), who underwent Aβ positron emission tomography and genetic testing. Using candidate AD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were previously identified, we investigated Aβ-associated SNPs that were shared or distinct between patients with SVCI and those with ADCI. Replication analyses were performed using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project cohorts (ROS/MAP). We identified a novel SNP, rs4732728, which showed distinct associations with Aβ positivity in patients with SVCI ( The novel genetic variants associated with	Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid beta; positron emission tomography; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP); subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI)

Identifying Aging and Alzheimer Disease-Associated Somatic Variations in Excitatory Neurons From the Human Frontal Cortex.	With age, somatic mutations accumulated in human brain cells can lead to various neurologic disorders and brain tumors. Because the incidence rate of Alzheimer disease (AD) increases exponentially with age, investigating the association between AD and the accumulation of somatic mutation can help understand the etiology of AD. We designed a somatic mutation detection workflow by contrasting genotypes derived from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data with genotypes derived from scRNA-seq data and applied this workflow to 76 participants from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort. We focused only on excitatory neurons, the dominant cell type in the scRNA-seq data. We identified 196 sites that harbored at least 1 individual with an excitatory neuron-specific somatic mutation (ENSM), and these 196 sites were mapped to 127 genes. The single base substitution (SBS) pattern of the putative ENSMs was best explained by signature SBS5 from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) mutational signatures, a clock-like pattern correlating with the age of the individual. The count of ENSMs per individual also showed an increasing trend with age. Among the mutated sites, we found 2 sites tend to have more mutations in older individuals (16:6899517 [ Our results show that combining scRNA-seq and WGS data can successfully detect putative somatic mutations. The putative somatic mutations detected from ROSMAP data set have provided new insights into the association of AD and aging with brain somatic mutagenesis.

Locus coeruleus pathology is associated with cerebral microangiopathy at autopsy.	We investigated the link between locus coeruleus (LC) pathology and cerebral microangiopathy in two large neuropathology datasets. We included data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database (n = 2197) and Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP; n = 1637). Generalized estimating equations and logistic regression were used to examine associations between LC hypopigmentation and presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) or arteriolosclerosis, correcting for age at death, sex, cortical Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, ante mortem cognitive status, and presence of vascular and genetic risk factors. LC hypopigmentation was associated with higher odds of overall CAA in the NACC dataset, leptomeningeal CAA in the ROSMAP dataset, and arteriolosclerosis in both datasets. LC pathology is associated with cerebral microangiopathy, independent of cortical AD pathology. LC degeneration could potentially contribute to the pathways relating vascular pathology to AD. Future studies of the LC-norepinephrine system on cerebrovascular health are warranted. We associated locus coeruleus (LC) pathology and cerebral microangiopathy in two large autopsy datasets. LC hypopigmentation was consistently related to arteriolosclerosis in both datasets. LC hypopigmentation was related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) presence in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset. LC hypopigmentation was related to leptomeningeal CAA in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project dataset. LC degeneration may play a role in the pathways relating vascular pathology to Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease; arteriolosclerosis; autopsy; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; locus coeruleus

Identification of novel functional brain proteins for treatment-resistant schizophrenia: Based on a proteome-wide association study.	Genetic approaches are increasingly advantageous in characterizing treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). We aimed to identify TRS-associated functional brain proteins, providing a potential pathway for improving psychiatric classification and developing better-tailored therapeutic targets. TRS-related proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) were conducted on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from CLOZUK and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), which provided TRS individuals ( In PWAS, two statistically significant proteins were identified using the ROS/MAP and then replicated using the Banner reference dataset, including CPT2 ( Our results identified two protein biomarkers, and cautiously support that the pathological mechanism of TRS is linked to lipid oxidation and inflammation, where mitochondria-related functions may play a role.

Previous post-mortem assessments of TREM2 expression and its association with brain pathologies have been limited by sample size. This study sought to correlate region-specific TREM2 mRNA expression with diverse neuropathological measures at autopsy using a large sample size (N = 945) of bulk RNA sequencing data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP). TREM2 gene expression of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and caudate nucleus was assessed with respect to core pathology of Alzheimer's disease (amyloid-β, and tau), cerebrovascular pathology (cerebral infarcts, arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy), microglial activation (proportion of activated microglia), and cognitive performance. We found that cortical TREM2 levels were positively related to AD diagnosis, cognitive decline, and amyloid-β neuropathology but were not related to the proportion of activated microglia. In contrast, caudate TREM2 levels were not related to AD pathology, cognition, or diagnosis, but were positively related to the proportion of activated microglia in the same region. Diagnosis-stratified results revealed caudate TREM2 levels were inversely related to AD neuropathology and positively related to microglial activation and longitudinal cognitive performance in AD cases.

PolyAMiner-Bulk: A Machine Learning Based Bioinformatics Algorithm to Infer and Decode Alternative Polyadenylation Dynamics from bulk RNA-seq data.	More than half of human genes exercise alternative polyadenylation (APA) and generate mRNA transcripts with varying 3' untranslated regions (UTR). However, current computational approaches for identifying cleavage and polyadenylation sites (C/PASs) and quantifying 3'UTR length changes from bulk RNA-seq data fail to unravel tissue- and disease-specific APA dynamics. Here, we developed a next-generation bioinformatics algorithm and application, PolyAMiner-Bulk, that utilizes an attention-based machine learning architecture and an improved vector projection-based engine to infer differential APA dynamics accurately. When applied to earlier studies, PolyAMiner-Bulk accurately identified more than twice the number of APA changes in an RBM17 knockdown bulk RNA-seq dataset compared to current generation tools. Moreover, on a separate dataset, PolyAMiner-Bulk revealed novel APA dynamics and pathways in scleroderma pathology and identified differential APA in a gene that was identified as being involved in scleroderma pathogenesis in an independent study. Lastly, we used PolyAMiner-Bulk to analyze the RNA-seq data of post-mortem prefrontal cortexes from the ROSMAP data consortium and unraveled novel APA dynamics in Alzheimer's Disease. Our method, PolyAMiner-Bulk, creates a paradigm for future alternative polyadenylation analysis from bulk RNA-seq data.

Brain proteome-wide association study linking-genes in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis.	To identify genes that confer MS risk via the alteration of cis-regulated protein abundance and verify their aberrant expression in human brain. Utilizing a two-stage proteome-wide association study (PWAS) design, MS GWAS data (N = 41,505) was respectively integrated with two distinct human brain proteomes from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, including ROSMAP (N = 376) in the discovery stage and Banner (N = 152) in the confirmation stage. In the following, Bayesian colocalization analysis was conducted for GWAS and protein quantitative trait loci signals to prioritize candidate genes. Differential expression analysis was then used to verify the dysregulation of risk genes in white matter and gray matter for evidence at the transcription level. A total of 51 genes whose protein abundance had association with the MS risk were identified, of which 18 genes overlapped in the discovery and confirmation PWAS. Bayesian colocalization indicated six causal genes with genetic risk variants for the MS risk. The differential expression analysis of SHMT1 (P Dysregulation of SHMT1, FAM120B and ICA1L may confer MS risk. Our findings shed new light on the pathogenesis of MS and prioritized promising targets for future therapy research.

Differential Gene Expression and DNA Methylation in the Risk of Depression in LOAD Patients.	Depression is common among late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) patients. Only a few studies investigated the genetic variability underlying the comorbidity of depression in LOAD. Moreover, the epigenetic and transcriptomic factors that may contribute to comorbid depression in LOAD have yet to be studied. Using transcriptomic and DNA-methylomic datasets from the ROSMAP cohorts, we investigated differential gene expression and DNA-methylation in LOAD patients with and without comorbid depression. Differential expression analysis did not reveal significant association between differences in gene expression and the risk of depression in LOAD.

Because dementia is progressive, incident cases are on average milder than prevalent cases, affecting the performance of cognitive tests and questions on functional limitations (i.e., cognition/functional limitation items) used for dementia assessment. Longitudinal studies assess incident cases, while cross-sectional studies assess prevalent cases, but differences are not typically considered when researchers select items to include in studies. We used longitudinal data from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) (n = 3,446) collected between 1994 and 2021 to characterize differences in associations between items (cognition: 35 items; functional limitations: 14 items) and incident or prevalent dementia using multinomial regression models with generalized estimating equations, controlling for ROSMAP cohort (Religious Orders Study or Memory and Aging Project), age, sex, race, and education. The association between a given item and incident dementia was significantly weaker than the association between the same item and prevalent dementia for 46 of 49 items. However, there was variability, with larger differences for some items, including naming a pencil (prevalence odds ratio = 0.02 (95% confidence interval: 0.02, 0.03); incidence odds ratio = 0.10 (95% confidence interval: 0.06, 0.17); P for difference < 0.001). Important differences exist in the performance of cognition/functional limitation items for measurement of incident versus prevalent dementia. Differences can inform the choice of items for cross-sectional studies of prevalent cases or longitudinal studies of incident cases, leading to reduced misclassification and increased statistical power.	aging; cognitive testing; dementia; functional limitations; measurement; study design

DeepPerVar: a multi-modal deep learning framework for functional interpretation of genetic variants in personal genome.	Understanding the functional consequence of genetic variants, especially the non-coding ones, is important but particularly challenging. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or quantitative trait locus analyses may be subject to limited statistical power and linkage disequilibrium, and thus are less optimal to pinpoint the causal variants. Moreover, most existing machine-learning approaches, which exploit the functional annotations to interpret and prioritize putative causal variants, cannot accommodate the heterogeneity of personal genetic variations and traits in a population study, targeting a specific disease. By leveraging paired whole-genome sequencing data and epigenetic functional assays in a population study, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict genome-wide quantitative epigenetic signals by considering both personal genetic variations and traits. The proposed approach can further evaluate the functional consequence of non-coding variants on an individual level by quantifying the allelic difference of predicted epigenetic signals. By applying the approach to the ROSMAP cohort studying Alzheimer's disease (AD), we demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict quantitative genome-wide epigenetic signals and in key genomic regions of AD causal genes, learn canonical motifs reported to regulate gene expression of AD causal genes, improve the partitioning heritability analysis and prioritize putative causal variants in a GWAS risk locus. Finally, we release the proposed deep learning model as a stand-alone Python toolkit and a web server. https://github.com/lichen-lab/DeepPerVar.

Weakly activated core neuroinflammation pathways were identified as a central signaling mechanism contributing to the chronic neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.	Neuroinflammation signaling has been identified as an important hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in addition to amyloid β plaques (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). However, the molecular mechanisms and biological processes of neuroinflammation remain unclear and have not well delineated using transcriptomics data available. Our objectives are to uncover the core neuroinflammation signaling pathways in AD using integrative network analysis on the transcriptomics data. From a novel perspective, i.e., investigating weakly activated molecular signals (rather than the strongly activated molecular signals), we developed integrative and systems biology network analysis to uncover potential core neuroinflammation signaling targets and pathways in AD using the two large-scale transcriptomics datasets, i.e., Mayo Clinic (77 controls and 81 AD samples) and ROSMAP (97 controls and 260 AD samples). Our analysis identified interesting core neuroinflammation signaling pathways, which are not systematically reported in the previous studies of AD. Specifically, we identified 7 categories of signaling pathways implicated on AD and related to virus infection: immune response, x-core signaling, apoptosis, lipid dysfunctional, biosynthesis and metabolism, and mineral absorption signaling pathways. More interestingly, most of the genes in the virus infection, immune response, and x-core signaling pathways are associated with inflammation molecular functions. The x-core signaling pathways were defined as a group of 9 signaling proteins: MAPK, Rap1, NF-kappa B, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, Wnt, TGF-beta, Hippo, and TNF, which indicated the core neuroinflammation signaling pathways responding to the low-level and weakly activated inflammation and hypoxia and leading to the chronic neurodegeneration. It is interesting to investigate the detailed signaling cascades of these weakly activated neuroinflammation signaling pathways causing neurodegeneration in a chronic process, and consequently uncover novel therapeutic targets for effective AD treatment and prevention. The potential core neuroinflammation and associated signaling targets and pathways were identified using integrative network analysis on two large-scale transcriptomics datasets of AD.

"The classic pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (AD neuropathologic changes, or ADNC). However, brains from individuals clinically diagnosed with ""AD-type"" (amnestic) dementia usually harbor heterogeneous neuropathologies in addition to, or other than, ADNC. We hypothesized that some AD-type dementia associated genetic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified from large genomewide association studies (GWAS) were associated with non-ADNC neuropathologies. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from multiple studies with available genotype and neuropathologic phenotype information. Clinical AD/dementia risk alleles of interest were derived from the very large GWAS by Bellenguez et al. (2022) who reported 83 clinical AD/dementia-linked SNVs in addition to the APOE risk alleles. To query the pathologic phenotypes associated with variation of those SNVs, National Alzheimer's disease Coordinating Center (NACC) neuropathologic data were linked to AD Sequencing Project (ADSP) and AD Genomics Consortium (ADGC) data. Separate data were obtained from the harmonized Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). A total of 4811 European participants had at least ADNC neuropathology data and also genotype data available; data were meta-analyzed across cohorts. As expected, a subset of dementia-associated SNVs were associated with ADNC risk in Europeans-e.g., BIN1, PICALM, CR1, MME, and COX7C. Other gene variants linked to (clinical) AD dementia were associated with non-ADNC pathologies. For example, the associations of GRN and TMEM106B SNVs with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) were replicated. In addition, SNVs in TNIP1 and WNT3 previously reported as AD-related were instead associated with hippocampal sclerosis pathology. Some genotype/neuropathology association trends were not statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05 after correcting for multiple testing, but were intriguing. For example, variants in SORL1 and TPCN1 showed trends for association with LATE-NC whereas Lewy body pathology trended toward association with USP6NL and BIN1 gene variants. A smaller cohort of non-European subjects (n = 273, approximately one-half of whom were African-Americans) provided the basis for additional exploratory analyses. Overall, these findings were consistent with the hypothesis that some genetic variants linked to AD dementia risk exert their affect by influencing non-ADNC neuropathologies."

The effect of Alzheimer's disease genetic factors on limbic white matter microstructure.	White matter (WM) microstructure is essential for brain function but deteriorates with age and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diffusion MRI, enhanced by advanced bi-tensor models accounting for free water (FW), enables in vivo quantification of WM microstructural differences. To evaluate how AD genetic risk factors affect limbic WM microstructure - crucial for memory and early impacted in disease - we conducted linear regression analyses in a cohort of 2,614 non-Hispanic White aging adults (aged 50.12 to 100.85 years). The study evaluated 36 AD risk variants across 26 genes, the association between AD polygenic scores (PGSs) and WM metrics, and interactions with cognitive status. AD PGSs, variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and apolipoprotein E (APOE), and interactions involving MS4A6A were significantly linked to WM microstructure. These findings implicate AD-related genetic factors related to neurodevelopment (WNT3), lipid metabolism (APOE), and inflammation (TMEM106B, PTK2B, MS4A6A) that contribute to alternations in WM microstructure in older adults. AD risk variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and APOE genes showed distinct associations with limbic FW-corrected WM microstructure metrics.

Enhancing nonlinear transcriptome- and proteome-wide association studies via trait imputation with applications to Alzheimer's disease.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed on large cohort and biobank datasets have identified many genetic loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the younger demographic of biobank participants relative to the typical age of late-onset AD has resulted in an insufficient number of AD cases, limiting the statistical power of GWAS and any downstream analyses. To mitigate this limitation, several trait imputation methods have been proposed to impute the expected future AD status of individuals who may not have yet developed the disease. This paper explores the use of imputed AD status in nonlinear transcriptome/proteome-wide association studies (TWAS/PWAS) to identify genes and proteins whose genetically regulated expression is associated with AD risk. In particular, we considered the TWAS/PWAS method DeLIVR, which utilizes deep learning to model the nonlinear effects of expression on disease. We trained transcriptome and proteome imputation models for DeLIVR on data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project and the UK Biobank (UKB), respectively, with imputed AD status in UKB participants as the outcome. Next, we performed hypothesis testing for the DeLIVR models using clinically diagnosed AD cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Our results demonstrate that nonlinear TWAS/PWAS trained with imputed AD outcomes successfully identifies known and putative AD risk genes and proteins. Notably, we found that training with imputed outcomes can increase statistical power without inflating false positives, enabling the discovery of molecular exposures with potentially nonlinear effects on neurodegeneration.

Amyloid PET predicts longitudinal functional and cognitive trajectories in a heterogeneous cohort.	Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly available for diagnosis of Alzheimer`s disease (AD); however, its practical implications in heterogenous cohorts are debated. Amyloid PET from 890 National Alzheimer`s Coordinating Center participants with up to 10 years post-PET follow up was analyzed. Cox proportional hazards and linear mixed models were used to investigate amyloid burden prediction of etiology and prospective functional status and cognitive decline. Amyloid positivity was associated with progression from unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Amyloid burden in the unimpaired group was associated with lower initial memory levels and faster decline in memory, language, and global cognition. In the Impaired group, amyloid was associated with lower initial levels and faster decline for memory, language, executive function, and global cognition. Amyloid burden is an important prognostic marker in a clinically heterogeneous cohort. Future work is needed to establish the proportion of decline driven by AD versus non-AD processes in the context of mixed pathology. Our findings highlight the importance of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) in heterogenous cohorts, including diverse demographics, clinical syndromes, and underlying etiologies. The results also provide evidence that higher amyloid levels were linked to functional progression from unimpaired cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to dementia. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, higher amyloid burden was associated with poorer memory at baseline and subsequent declines in memory, language, and global cognition. Among individuals with cognitive impairment, amyloid burden was associated with worse initial memory, language, executive function, and global cognition, and faster declines over time.

Improved stoichiometric model for megavoltage computed tomography number conversion and dose calculation within the TomoTherapy delivery system.	This study investigated a novel stoichiometric computed tomography (CT) number calibration (SCC) model for megavoltage CT (MVCT). This model was specifically designed to convert CT numbers to mass densities (MDs) for dose calculations when using the TomoTherapy MVCT radiotherapy delivery system. The MVCT-SCC model extended the conventional SCC model originally developed for kilovoltage CT by incorporating additional parameters to account for pair production and water-equivalent CT number corrections, which are specific to MVCT applications. The accuracy of the model was evaluated through a benchmark test that involved comparing its performance to those of three conventional models using a Catphan700 phantom equipped with 10 density plugs and air. The MVCT numbers derived from the MVCT-SCC and conventional models were assessed by comparing them to the actual measured values using the root mean square error (RMSE) in Hounsfield units (HU). Additionally, potential percentage estimated mean dose error (PMDE) discrepancies were quantified based on the tolerances specified in the CT-MD conversion table and the observed RMSE values. The RMSE for the MVCT numbers calculated with the MVCT-SCC model was significantly lower, at 10.8 HU, compared to values of >35.3 HU for the conventional models. Furthermore, the PMDE when using the MVCT-SCC model was within 1 %, which was significantly better than the differences of >2 % observed with the conventional models. The results of the benchmark test confirmed that the MVCT-SCC model significantly enhanced the accuracy of the calculated HU numbers and dose estimates compared to conventional models.

Although many studies have investigated the influence of HLA on the risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), there have been inconsistent results. Part of this problem has been attributed to limitations of a clinical assessment in the absence of histopathological confirmation or other quantitative assessments. This study employed a subset of the AD Sequencing Project, representing 2663 cases with histopathological confirmation of AD and confirmation of 881 cognitively normal cases. Two HLA allelic subtypes, DQB1*02:01 and DQB1*02:02, were associated with lower Braak staging, a measure of tauopathy in the brain. These HLA subtypes were also associated with a later age of onset. There was a lower occurrence of HLA-DQB1*02:01 and HLA-DQB1*02:02 in AD cases compared to cognitively normal cases. For all of the above results, replicative sets were confirmatory. The above results were also maintained for both HLA-DQB1*02:01 and HLA-DQB1*02:02 when removing the effect of APOE4 or APOE2. Interestingly, the HLA-DQB1*02 allele binds tau better than all other HLA-DQB1 alleles tested, per an in silico assessment, raising the question of whether deletion of tau binding, auto-reactive T-cells in the thymus could reduce the likelihood of the onset of AD?

Whole Genome Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis in Alzheimer Disease.	Investigation into different allelic variants may yield new associative genes to predict late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) are important polymorphic components of the genome; however, they have been previously overlooked because of their complex genotyping. New software can now determine differing lengths of VNTRs; however, this has not been tested in a large case-control population. We used VNTRseek to genotype over 200,000 tandem repeats in 9,501 cases and controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. We first identified limiting factors of this analysis and then examined the association of VNTRs with AD diagnosis in a subset of non-Hispanic White participants. We found that VNTRs were highly associated with areas of the genome with a high number of previously identified variants. From our case-control analysis, we identified 9 VNTRs with a repeat allele length associated with LOAD including VNTRs on DSC3, NR2E3, CCNY, PKP4, GRAP, and MAP6. We were able to show the feasibility of this new type of analysis in large-scale whole-genome sequencing data and identify promising VNTRs that are associated with LOAD.

Effect of different modified potato starch on starch-based films containing ZIF-67@thymol.	Zeolite imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) was used to encapsulate thymol (THY) to improve the properties of potato starch films. The effect of different modified potato starches (acetate starch (AS), hydroxypropyl di-starch phosphate (HDSP), oxidized hydroxypropyl starch (OHS), and acetylated di-starch phosphate (ADSP)) on the film properties was investigated. The results showed that the modified potato starch film had better water resistance, mechanical property, and water vapor barrier than the natural potato starch film. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed that the smoothness of the modified film was advanced. Notably, the OHS film had the best oxidation resistance activity of 76.93 % compared to the other four films. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were significantly inhibited in all potato starch films enhanced with ZIF-67@THY. Therefore, starch-based films incorporating ZIF-67@THY have a broad application prospect in food packaging.	Potato modified starch film; Thymol; Zeolite imidazolate framework

The Dynamics of Cognitive Decline towards Alzheimer's Disease Progression: Results from ADSP-PHC's Harmonized Cognitive Composites.	Accurately assessing temporal order of cognitive decline across multiple domains is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing literature presented controversial conclusions likely due to the use of a single cohort and different analytical strategies. Harmonized composite cognitive measures in memory, language and executive functions from 13 cohorts in the ADSP-PHC data are used. A novel double anchoring events-based sigmoidal mixed model was developed using time to the incident of AD diagnosis as the time scale. Decline in memory occurred before decline in language which was followed by the decline in executive function. Throughout the entire AD continuum, APOE- Using harmonized data across multiple cohorts is the key to accurately characterizing the temporal order of AD biomarkers. Time to incident AD diagnosis should be used as the time scale for reproducibility purposes.	ADSP-PHC; cognitive decline; harmonized composite measures; sigmoidal mixed model; temporal order

LD-informed deep learning for Alzheimer's gene loci detection using WGS data.	The exponential growth of genomic datasets necessitates advanced analytical tools to effectively identify genetic loci from large-scale high throughput sequencing data. This study presents Deep-Block, a multi-stage deep learning framework that incorporates biological knowledge into its AI architecture to identify genetic regions as significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The framework employs a three-stage approach: (1) genome segmentation based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns, (2) selection of relevant LD blocks using sparse attention mechanisms, and (3) application of TabNet and Random Forest algorithms to quantify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) feature importance, thereby identifying genetic factors contributing to AD risk. The Deep-Block was applied to a large-scale whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), comprising 7416 non-Hispanic white (NHW) participants (3150 cognitively normal older adults (CN), 4266 AD). 30,218 LD blocks were identified and then ranked based on their relevance with Alzheimer's disease. Subsequently, the Deep-Block identified novel SNPs within the top 1500 LD blocks and confirmed previously known variants, including The Deep-Block framework effectively processes large-scale high throughput sequencing data while preserving SNP interactions during dimensionality reduction, minimizing bias and information loss. The framework's findings are supported by tissue-specific eQTL evidence across brain regions, indicating the functional relevance of the identified variants. Additionally, the Deep-Block approach has identified both known and novel genetic variants, enhancing our understanding of the genetic architecture and demonstrating its potential for application in large-scale sequencing studies. Growing genomic datasets require advanced tools to identify genetic loci in sequencing.Deep-Block, a novel AI framework, was used to process large-scale ADSP WGS data.Deep-Block identified both known and novel AD-associated genetic loci.rs429358 (	Alzheimer's disease; deep learning; genetic loci; imputation methods; linkage disequilibrium; whole‐genome sequencing

Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Release 4 Whole Genome Sequencing Dataset.	The Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a national initiative to understand the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) by sequencing whole genomes of affected participants and age-matched cognitive controls from diverse populations. The Genome Center for Alzheimer's Disease (GCAD) processed whole-genome sequencing data from 36,361 ADSP participants, including 35,014 genetically unique participants of which 45% are from non-European ancestry, across 17 cohorts in 14 countries in this fourth release (R4). This sequencing effort identified 387 million bi-allelic variants, 42 million short insertions/deletions, and 2.2 million structural variants. Annotations and quality control data are available for all variants and samples. Additionally, detailed phenotypes from 15,927 participants across 10 domains are also provided. A linkage disequilibrium panel was created using unrelated AD cases and controls. Researchers can access and analyze the genetic data via NIAGADS Data Sharing Service, the VariXam tool, or NIAGADS GenomicsDB.

Biologically Enhanced Machine Learning Model to uncover Novel Gene-Drug Targets for Alzheimer's Disease.	Given the complexity and multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, investigating potential drug-gene targets is imperative for developing effective therapies and advancing our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the disease. We present an explainable ML model that integrates the role and impact of gene interactions to drive the genomic variant feature selection. The model leverages both the Alzheimer's knowledge base and the Drug-Gene interaction database (DGIdb) to identify a list of biologically plausible novel gene-drug targets for further investigation. Model validation is performed on an ethnically diverse study sample obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), a multi-ancestry multi-cohort genomic study. To mitigate population stratification and spurious associations from ML analysis, we implemented novel data curation methods. The study outcomes include a set of possible gene targets for further functional follow-up and drug repurposing.

Copy number variants (CNVs) are DNA gains or losses involving >50 base pairs. Assessing CNV effects on disease risk requires consideration of several factors. First, there are no natural definitions for CNV loci. Second, CNV effects can depend on dosage and length. Third, CNV effects can be more accurately estimated when all CNV events in a genomic region are analyzed together to assess their joint effects. We propose a new framework for association analysis that directly models an individual's entire CNV profile within a genomic region. This framework represents an individual's CNVs using a CNV profile curve to capture variations in CNV length and dosage and to bypass the need to predefine CNV loci. CNV effects are estimated at each genome position, making the results comparable across different studies. To jointly estimate the effects of all CNVs, we use a Lasso penalty to select CNVs associated with the trait and integrate a weighted L2-fusion penalty to encourage similar effects of adjacent CNVs when supported by the data. Simulations show that the proposed model can more effectively identify causal CNVs while maintaining false positive rates comparable to baseline methods and yield more precise effect-size estimates across different settings. When applied to CNV derived from whole genome sequencing data of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, the proposed methods identify additional CNVs associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). These identified CNVs overlap with several known AD-risk genes and are significantly enriched by biological processes related to neuron structures and functions crucial in AD development.

Biobank-scale characterization of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias identifies potential disease-causing variants, risk factors, and genetic modifiers across diverse ancestries.	Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRDs) pose a significant global public health challenge, underscored by the intricate interplay of genetic and environmental factors that differ across ancestries. To effectively implement equitable, personalized therapeutic interventions on a global scale, it is essential to identify disease-causing mutations and genetic risk and resilience factors across diverse ancestral backgrounds. Exploring genetic-phenotypic correlations across the globe enhances the generalizability of research findings, contributing to a more inclusive and universal understanding of disease. This study leveraged biobank-scale data to conduct the largest multi-ancestry whole-genome sequencing characterization of AD/ADRDs. We aimed to build a valuable catalog of potential disease-causing, genetic risk and resilience variants impacting the etiology of these conditions. We thoroughly characterized genetic variants from key genes associated with AD/ADRDs across 11 genetic ancestries, utilizing data from All of Us, UK Biobank, 100,000 Genomes Project, Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, and the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Parkinson's Disease, including a total of 25,001 cases and 93,542 controls. We prioritized 116 variants possibly linked to disease, including 18 known pathogenic and 98 novel variants. We detected previously described disease-causing variants among controls, leading us to question their pathogenicity. Notably, we showed a higher frequency of	100,000 Genomes Project; ADSP; AMP PD; All of Us; Alzheimer’s disease; UK Biobank; clinical trials; dementia; disease-causing variants; disease-modifying variants; genetic risk factors; genetics; protective variants; target prioritization

Time-dependent personalized prognostic analysis by machine learning in biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: a retrospective cohort study.	For biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, treatments such as radiation therapy and androgen deprivation therapy are administered. To diagnose postoperative recurrence as early as possible and to intervene with treatment at the appropriate time, it is essential to accurately predict recurrence after radical prostatectomy. However, postoperative recurrence involves numerous patient-related factors, making its prediction challenging. The purpose of this study is to accurately predict the timing of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and to analyze the risk factors for follow-up of high-risk patients and early detection of recurrence. We utilized the machine learning survival analysis model called the Random Survival Forest utilizing the 58 clinical factors from 548 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at Chiba University Hospital. To visualize prognostic factors and assess accuracy of the time course probability, we employed SurvSHAP(t) and time-dependent Area Under Cureve(AUC). The time-dependent AUC of RSF was 0.785, which outperformed the Cox proportional hazards model (0.704), the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score (0.710), and the D'Amico score (0.658). The key prognostic factors for early recurrence were Gleason score(GS), Seminal vesicle invasion(SV), and PSA. The contribution of PSA to recurrence decreases after the first year, while SV and GS increase over time. Our prognostic model analyzed the time-dependent relationship between the timing of recurrence and prognostic factors. Our study achieved personalized prognosis analysis and its rationale after radical prostatectomy by employing machine learning prognostic model. This prognostic model contributes to the early detection of recurrence by enabling clinicians to conduct appropriate follow-ups for high-risk patients.

Blood-derived mitochondrial DNA copy number is associated with Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer-related biomarkers and serum metabolites.	Blood-derived mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) is a proxy measurement of mitochondrial function in the peripheral and central systems. Abnormal mtDNA-CN not only indicates impaired mtDNA replication and transcription machinery but also dysregulated biological processes such as energy and lipid metabolism. However, the relationship between mtDNA-CN and Alzheimer disease (AD) is unclear. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using publicly available summary statistics from GWAS for mtDNA-CN and AD to investigate the causal relationship between mtDNA-CN and AD. We estimated mtDNA-CN using whole-genome sequence data from blood and brain samples of 13,799 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. Linear and Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, sex, and study phase were used to assess the association of mtDNA-CN with AD. The association of AD biomarkers and serum metabolites with mtDNA-CN in blood was evaluated in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using linear regression. We conducted a causal mediation analysis to test the natural indirect effects of mtDNA-CN change on AD risk through the significantly associated biomarkers and metabolites. MR analysis suggested a causal relationship between decreased blood-derived mtDNA-CN and increased risk of AD (OR = 0.68; P = 0.013). Survival analysis showed that decreased mtDNA-CN was significantly associated with higher risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD (HR = 0.80; P = 0.002). We also identified significant associations of mtDNA-CN with brain FDG-PET (β = 0.103; P = 0.022), amyloid-PET (β = 0.117; P = 0.034), CSF amyloid-β (Aβ) 42/40 (β=-0.124; P = 0.017), CSF t-Tau (β = 0.128; P = 0.015), p-Tau (β = 0.140; P = 0.008), and plasma NFL (β=-0.124; P = 0.004) in females. Several lipid species, amino acids, biogenic amines in serum were also significantly associated with mtDNA-CN. Causal mediation analyses showed that about a third of the effect of mtDNA-CN on AD risk was mediated by plasma NFL (P = 0.009), and this effect was more significant in females (P < 0.005). Our study indicates that mtDNA-CN measured in blood is predictive of AD and is associated with AD biomarkers including plasma NFL particularly in females. Further, we illustrate that decreased mtDNA-CN possibly increases AD risk through dysregulation of mitochondrial lipid metabolism and inflammation.

High-throughput capture and in situ protein analysis of extracellular vesicles by chemical probe-based array.	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small particles with phospholipid bilayers that carry a diverse range of cargoes including nucleic acids, proteins and metabolites. EVs have important roles in various cellular processes and are increasingly recognized for their ubiquitous role in cell-cell communications and potential applications in therapeutics and diagnostics. Although many methods have been developed for the characterization and measurement of EVs, analyzing them from biofluids remains a challenge with regard to throughput and sensitivity. Recently, we introduced an approach to facilitate high-throughput analysis of EVs from trace amounts of sample. In this method, an amphiphile-dendrimer supramolecular probe (ADSP) is coated onto a nitrocellulose membrane for array-based capture and to enable an in situ immunoblotting assay. Here, we describe the protocol for our array-based method of EV profiling. We describe an enhanced version of the method that incorporates an automated printing workstation, ensuring high throughput and reproducibility. We further demonstrate the use of our array to profile specific glycosylations on the EV surface using click chemistry of an azide group introduced by metabolic labeling. In this protocol, the synthesis of ADSP and the fabrication of ADSP nitrocellulose membrane array can be completed on the same day. EVs are efficiently captured from biological or clinical samples through a 30-min incubation, followed by an immunoblotting assay within a 3-h window, thus providing a high-throughput platform for EV isolation and in situ targeted analysis of EV proteins and their modifications.

Association of common and rare variants with Alzheimer's disease in more than 13,000 diverse individuals with whole-genome sequencing from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common disorder of the elderly that is both highly heritable and genetically heterogeneous. We investigated the association of AD with both common variants and aggregates of rare coding and non-coding variants in 13,371 individuals of diverse ancestry with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. Pooled-population analyses of all individuals identified genetic variants at apolipoprotein E (APOE) and BIN1 associated with AD (p < 5 × 10 We observed that complementary pooled-population and subgroup-specific analyses offered unique insights into the genetic architecture of AD. We determine the association of genetic variants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using 13,371 individuals of diverse ancestry with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. We identified genetic variants at apolipoprotein E (APOE), BIN1, PSEN1, and LINC00320 associated with AD. We observed rare non-coding variants in the promoter of TOMM40 distinct of APOE.

LD-informed deep learning for Alzheimer's gene loci detection using WGS data.	The exponential growth of genomic datasets necessitates advanced analytical tools to effectively identify genetic loci from large-scale high throughput sequencing data. This study presents Deep-Block, a multi-stage deep learning framework that incorporates biological knowledge into its AI architecture to identify genetic regions as significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The framework employs a three-stage approach: (1) genome segmentation based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns, (2) selection of relevant LD blocks using sparse attention mechanisms, and (3) application of TabNet and Random Forest algorithms to quantify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) feature importance, thereby identifying genetic factors contributing to AD risk. The Deep-Block was applied to a large-scale whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), comprising 7,416 non-Hispanic white participants (3,150 cognitively normal older adults (CN), 4,266 AD). 30,218 LD blocks were identified and then ranked based on their relevance with Alzheimer's disease. Subsequently, the Deep-Block identified novel SNPs within the top 1,500 LD blocks and confirmed previously known variants, including The Deep-Block framework effectively processes large-scale high throughput sequencing data while preserving SNP interactions during dimensionality reduction, minimizing bias and information loss. The framework's findings are supported by tissue-specific eQTL evidence across brain regions, indicating the functional relevance of the identified variants. Additionally, the Deep-Block approach has identified both known and novel genetic variants, enhancing our understanding of the genetic architecture and demonstrating its potential for application in large-scale sequencing studies.

Role of the X Chromosome in Alzheimer Disease Genetics.	The X chromosome has remained enigmatic in Alzheimer disease (AD), yet it makes up 5% of the genome and carries a high proportion of genes expressed in the brain, making it particularly appealing as a potential source of unexplored genetic variation in AD. To perform the first large-scale X chromosome-wide association study (XWAS) of AD. This was a meta-analysis of genetic association studies in case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts from the US Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, the UK Biobank, the Finnish health registry, and the US Million Veterans Program. Risk of AD was evaluated through case-control logistic regression analyses. Data were analyzed between January 2023 and March 2024. Genetic data available from high-density single-nucleotide variant microarrays and whole-genome sequencing and summary statistics for multitissue expression and protein quantitative trait loci available from published studies were included, enabling follow-up genetic colocalization analyses. A total of 1 629 863 eligible participants were selected from referred and volunteer samples, 477 596 of whom were excluded for analysis exclusion criteria. The number of participants who declined to participate in original studies was not available. Risk of AD, reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Associations were considered at X chromosome-wide (P < 1 × 10-5) and genome-wide (P < 5 × 10-8) significance. Primary analyses are nonstratified, while secondary analyses evaluate sex-stratified effects. Analyses included 1 152 284 participants of non-Hispanic White, European ancestry (664 403 [57.7%] female and 487 881 [42.3%] male), including 138 558 individuals with AD. Six independent genetic loci passed X chromosome-wide significance, with 4 showing support for links between the genetic signal for AD and expression of nearby genes in brain and nonbrain tissues. One of these 4 loci passed conservative genome-wide significance, with its lead variant centered on an intron of SLC9A7 (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04) and colocalization analyses prioritizing both the SLC9A7 and nearby CHST7 genes. Of these 6 loci, 4 displayed evidence for escape from X chromosome inactivation with regard to AD risk. This large-scale XWAS of AD identified the novel SLC9A7 locus. SLC9A7 regulates pH homeostasis in Golgi secretory compartments and is anticipated to have downstream effects on amyloid β accumulation. Overall, this study advances our knowledge of AD genetics and may provide novel biological drug targets. The results further provide initial insights into elucidating the role of the X chromosome in sex-based differences in AD.

Effects of acetylated distarch phosphate on the physicochemical characteristics and stability of the oyster sauce system.	In this study, the effect of different acetylated distarch phosphate (ADSP) ratios (0, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%) on the physicochemical characteristics and stability of the oyster sauce (OS) system was investigated. The texture, water state, interactions, rheological properties, microstructure, and stability of OS samples were analyzed through the texture analyser, low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR), particle diameter and zeta potential, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), rheometer, and microscopes. The results revealed that the addition of ADSP improved the firmness, consistency, cohesiveness, and water-holding capacity of OS. Moreover, ADSP reduced the average particle size and zeta potential of OS, indicating that electrostatic and steric stabilization existed in the ADSP-OS system. The addition of ADSP enhanced the hydrogen bonding and decreased water mobility for OS system, processing a more continuous and smooth structure. All ADSP-OS samples were typical non-Newtonian fluids with shear-thinning characteristics. In addition, the non-significant instability index changes of ADSP-OS over the whole storage period confirmed the excellent long-term stabilization capability of OS prepared with ADSP. This study provides a theoretical basis for starch-based sauce products and contributes to the development of sauce products.	acetylated distarch phosphate; interaction; microstructure; oyster sauce; physicochemical properties; stability of food

Disentangling the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project: Study design and methodology.	Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are highly prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are no effective treatments targeting these symptoms. To facilitate identification of causative mechanistic pathways, we initiated an effort (NIH: U01AG079850) to collate, harmonize, and analyze all available NPS data (≈ 100,000 samples) of diverse ancestries with whole-genome sequencing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). This study will generate a genomic resource for Alzheimer's disease with both harmonized whole-genome sequencing and NPS phenotype data that will be publicly available through NIAGADS. Primary analyses will (1) identify novel genetic risk factors associated with NPS in AD, (2) characterize the shared genetic architecture of NPS in AD and primary psychiatric disorders, and (3) assess the role of ancestry effects in the etiology of NPS in AD. Expansion of the ADSP to harmonize and refine NPS phenotypes coupled with the proposed core analyses will lay the foundation to disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying these detrimental symptoms in AD in diverse populations. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are highly prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD).There are no effective treatments targeting NPS in AD.The current effort aims to collate, harmonize, and analyze all NPS data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project.Core analyses will identify underlying genetic factors and mechanistic pathways.The harmonized genomic and phenotypic data from this initiative will be available through National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site.

Comparison of machine-learning and logistic regression models for prediction of 30-day unplanned readmission in electronic health records: A development and validation study.	It is expected but unknown whether machine-learning models can outperform regression models, such as a logistic regression (LR) model, especially when the number and types of predictor variables increase in electronic health records (EHRs). We aimed to compare the predictive performance of gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), deep neural network (DNN), and LR with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LR-LASSO) for unplanned readmission. We used EHRs of patients discharged alive from 38 hospitals in 2015-2017 for derivation and in 2018 for validation, including basic characteristics, diagnosis, surgery, procedure, and drug codes, and blood-test results. The outcome was 30-day unplanned readmission. We created six patterns of data tables having different numbers of binary variables (that ≥5% or ≥1% of patients or ≥10 patients had) with and without blood-test results. For each pattern of data tables, we used the derivation data to establish the machine-learning and LR models, and used the validation data to evaluate the performance of each model. The incidence of outcome was 6.8% (23,108/339,513 discharges) and 6.4% (7,507/118,074 discharges) in the derivation and validation datasets, respectively. For the first data table with the smallest number of variables (102 variables that ≥5% of patients had, without blood-test results), the c-statistic was highest for GBDT (0.740), followed by RF (0.734), LR-LASSO (0.720), and DNN (0.664). For the last data table with the largest number of variables (1543 variables that ≥10 patients had, including blood-test results), the c-statistic was highest for GBDT (0.764), followed by LR-LASSO (0.755), RF (0.751), and DNN (0.720), suggesting that the difference between GBDT and LR-LASSO was small and their 95% confidence intervals overlapped. In conclusion, GBDT generally outperformed LR-LASSO to predict unplanned readmission, but the difference of c-statistic became smaller as the number of variables was increased and blood-test results were used.

A Specialized Reference Panel with Structural Variants Integration for Improving Genotype Imputation in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).	We developed an imputation panel for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Recognizing the significant associations between structural variants (SVs) and AD, and their underrepresentation in existing public reference panels, our panel uniquely integrates single nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (indels), and SVs. This panel enhances the imputation of disease susceptibility, including rare AD-associated SNVs, indels, and SVs, onto genotype array data, offering a cost-effective alternative to whole-genome sequencing while significantly augmenting statistical power. Notably, we discovered 10 rare indels nominal significant related to AD that are absent in the TOPMed-r2 panel and identified three suggestive significant (p-value < 1E-05) AD-associated SVs in the genes EXOC3L2 and DMPK, were identified. These findings provide new insights into AD genetics and underscore the critical role of imputation panels in advancing our understanding of complex diseases like ADRD.

This study aims to enhance the physical properties and color stability of anthocyanin-based intelligent starch films. Three dual-modified starches, namely crosslinked-oxidized starch (COS), acetylated distarch phosphate (ADSP), and hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate (HDSP), were utilized as film matrices. Aronia melanocarpa anthocyanins were incorporated through three different pre-treatments (free, spray-drying microencapsulation, and freeze-drying microencapsulation) to assess the prepared films' functionality, stability, and applicability. The results indicate that the ADSP film exhibited an approximately two-fold increase in elongation at break (EAB) compared to native starch film. Specifically, the ADSP film's water contact angle (WCA) reached 90°, demonstrating excellent flexibility and hydrophobicity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed stronger interactions between anthocyanins and the film matrix after microencapsulation. Furthermore, after 30 days of exposure to 37 °C heat and light radiation, the freeze-dried anthocyanin-based intelligent film (FDA film) exhibited minimal fading, displaying the highest stability among the tested films. Notably, during beef freshness monitoring, the intelligent films underwent significant color changes as the beef deteriorated. In conclusion, the developed FDA film, with its outstanding stability and responsive pH characteristics, holds immense potential as a novel packaging material for food applications.

Memory CD8 T cells are vulnerable to chronic IFN-γ signals but not to CD4 T cell deficiency in MHCII-deficient mice.	The mechanisms by which the number of memory CD8 T cells is stably maintained remains incompletely understood. It has been postulated that maintaining them requires help from CD4 T cells, because adoptively transferred memory CD8 T cells persist poorly in MHC class II (MHCII)-deficient mice. Here we show that chronic interferon-γ signals, not CD4 T cell-deficiency, are responsible for their attrition in MHCII-deficient environments. Excess IFN-γ is produced primarily by endogenous colonic CD8 T cells in MHCII-deficient mice. IFN-γ neutralization restores the number of memory CD8 T cells in MHCII-deficient mice, whereas repeated IFN-γ administration or transduction of a gain-of-function STAT1 mutant reduces their number in wild-type mice.

ARID5B is a negative modulator of IL-6 production in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts.	Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissues revealed the heterogeneity of RA synovial fibroblasts (SFs) with distinct functions such as high IL-6 production. The molecular mechanisms responsible for high IL-6 production will become a promising drug target of RASFs to treat RA. In this study, we performed siRNA screening of 65 transcription factors (TFs) differentially expressed among RASF subsets to identify TFs involved in IL-6 production.

MitoH3: Mitochondrial Haplogroup and Homoplasmic/Heteroplasmic Variant Calling Pipeline for Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project.	Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a double-stranded circular DNA and has multiple copies in each cell. Excess heteroplasmy, the coexistence of distinct variants in copies of mtDNA within a cell, may lead to mitochondrial impairments. Accurate determination of heteroplasmy in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data has posed a significant challenge because mitochondria carrying heteroplasmic variants cannot be distinguished during library preparation. Moreover, sequencing errors, contamination, and nuclear mtDNA segments can reduce the accuracy of heteroplasmic variant calling. To efficiently and accurately call mtDNA homoplasmic and heteroplasmic variants from the large-scale WGS data generated from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), and test their association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we present MitoH3-a comprehensive computational pipeline for calling mtDNA homoplasmic and heteroplasmic variants and inferring haplogroups in the ADSP WGS data. We first applied MitoH3 to 45 technical replicates from 6 subjects to define a threshold for detecting heteroplasmic variants. Then using the threshold of 5% ≤variant allele fraction≤95%, we further applied MitoH3 to call heteroplasmic variants from a total of 16,113 DNA samples with 6,742 samples from cognitively normal controls and 6,183 from AD cases. This pipeline is available through the Singularity container engine. For 4,311 heteroplasmic variants identified from 16,113 samples, no significant variant count difference was observed between AD cases and controls. Our streamlined pipeline, MitoH3, enables computationally efficient and accurate analysis of a large number of samples.

The Role of X Chromosome in Alzheimer's Disease Genetics.	The X chromosome has remained enigmatic in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet it makes up 5% of the genome and carries a high proportion of genes expressed in the brain, making it particularly appealing as a potential source of unexplored genetic variation in AD. Perform the first large-scale X chromosome-wide association study (XWAS) of AD. Primary analyses are non-stratified, while secondary analyses evaluate sex-stratified effects. Meta-analysis of genetic association studies in case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts from the US Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), the UK Biobank (UKB), the Finnish health registry (FinnGen), and the US Million Veterans Program (MVP). Risk for AD evaluated through case-control logistic regression analyses. Data were analyzed between January 2023 and March 2024. Genetic data available from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Summary statistics for multi-tissue expression and protein quantitative trait loci (QTL) available from published studies, enabling follow-up genetic colocalization analyses. 1,629,863 eligible participants were selected from referred and volunteer samples, of which 477,596 were excluded for analysis exclusion criteria. Number of participants who declined to participate in original studies was not available. Risk for AD (odds ratio; OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Associations were considered at X-chromosome-wide (P-value<1e-5) and genome-wide (P-value<5e-8) significance. Analyses included 1,152,284 non-Hispanic White European ancestry subjects (57.3% females), including 138,558 cases. 6 independent genetic loci passed X-chromosome-wide significance, with 4 showing support for causal links between the genetic signal for AD and expression of nearby genes in brain and non-brain tissues. One of these 4 loci passed conservative genome-wide significance, with its lead variant centered on an intron of We performed the first large-scale XWAS of AD and identified the novel

The 2022 symposium on dementia and brain aging in low- and middle-income countries: Highlights on research, diagnosis, care, and impact.	Two of every three persons living with dementia reside in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The projected increase in global dementia rates is expected to affect LMICs disproportionately. However, the majority of global dementia care costs occur in high-income countries (HICs), with dementia research predominantly focusing on HICs. This imbalance necessitates LMIC-focused research to ensure that characterization of dementia accurately reflects the involvement and specificities of diverse populations. Development of effective preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches for dementia in LMICs requires targeted, personalized, and harmonized efforts. Our article represents timely discussions at the 2022 Symposium on Dementia and Brain Aging in LMICs that identified the foremost opportunities to advance dementia research, differential diagnosis, use of neuropsychometric tools, awareness, and treatment options. We highlight key topics discussed at the meeting and provide future recommendations to foster a more equitable landscape for dementia prevention, diagnosis, care, policy, and management in LMICs. HIGHLIGHTS: Two-thirds of persons with dementia live in LMICs, yet research and costs are skewed toward HICs. LMICs expect dementia prevalence to more than double, accompanied by socioeconomic disparities. The 2022 Symposium on Dementia in LMICs addressed advances in research, diagnosis, prevention, and policy. The Nairobi Declaration urges global action to enhance dementia outcomes in LMICs.

Dimension reduction of microbiome data linked Bifidobacterium and Prevotella to allergic rhinitis.	Dimension reduction has been used to visualise the distribution of multidimensional microbiome data, but the composite variables calculated by the dimension reduction methods have not been widely used to investigate the relationship of the human gut microbiome with lifestyle and disease. In the present study, we applied several dimension reduction methods, including principal component analysis, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), and non-negative matrix factorization, to a microbiome dataset from 186 subjects with symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) and 106 controls. All the dimension reduction methods supported that the distribution of microbial data points appeared to be continuous rather than discrete. Comparison of the composite variables calculated from the different dimension reduction methods showed that the characteristics of the composite variables differed depending on the distance matrices and the dimension reduction methods. The first composite variables calculated from PCoA and NMDS with the UniFrac distance were strongly associated with AR (FDR adjusted P = 2.4 × 10

On the effect heterogeneity of established disease susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease across different genetic ancestries.	Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous disease susceptibility loci (DSLs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, only a limited number of studies have investigated the dependence of the genetic effect size of established DSLs on genetic ancestry. We utilized the whole genome sequencing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) including 35,569 participants. A total of 25,459 subjects in four distinct populations (African ancestry, non-Hispanic White, admixed Hispanic, and Asian) were analyzed. We found that nine DSLs showed significant heterogeneity across populations. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2075650 in translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOMM40) showed the largest heterogeneity (Cochran's Q = 0.00, I We observed substantial heterogeneity for the APOE-harboring 19q13.32 region with TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 genes. The largest risk effect was seen among African Americans, while Asians showed a surprisingly small risk effect.

Key variants via the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project whole genome sequence data.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but did not identify specific causal genes or variants within those loci. Analysis of whole genome sequence (WGS) data, which interrogates the entire genome and captures rare variations, may identify causal variants within GWAS loci. We performed single common variant association analysis and rare variant aggregate analyses in the pooled population (N cases = 2184, N controls = 2383) and targeted analyses in subpopulations using WGS data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). The analyses were restricted to variants within 100 kb of 83 previously identified GWAS lead variants. Seventeen variants were significantly associated with AD within five genomic regions implicating the genes OARD1/NFYA/TREML1, JAZF1, FERMT2, and SLC24A4. KAT8 was implicated by both single variant and rare variant aggregate analyses. This study demonstrates the utility of leveraging WGS to gain insights into AD loci identified via GWAS.

Association of Structural Forms of 17q21.31 with the Risk of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and	The chromosome 17q21.31 region, containing a 900 Kb inversion that defines H1 and H2 haplotypes, represents the strongest genetic risk locus in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In addition to H1 and H2, various structural forms of 17q21.31, characterized by the copy number of α, β, and γ duplications, have been identified. However, the specific effect of each structural form on the risk of PSP has never been evaluated in a large cohort study. To assess the association of different structural forms of 17q.21.31, defined by the copy numbers of α, β, and γ duplications, with the risk of PSP and Utilizing whole genome sequencing data of 1,684 (1,386 autopsy confirmed) individuals with PSP and 2,392 control subjects, a case-control study was conducted to investigate the association of copy numbers of α, β, and γ duplications and structural forms of 17q21.31 with the risk of PSP. All study subjects were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) Umbrella NG00067.v7. Data were analyzed between March 2022 and November 2023. The main outcomes were the risk (odds ratios [ORs]) for PSP with 95% CIs. Risks for PSP were evaluated by logistic regression models. The copy numbers of α and β were associated with the risk of PSP only due to their correlation with H1 and H2, while the copy number of γ was independently associated with the increased risk of PSP. Each additional duplication of γ was associated with 1.10 (95% CI, 1.04-1.17; This study revealed that the copy number of γ was associated with the risk of PSP independently from H1 and H2. The H1 haplotype with more γ duplications showed a higher odds ratio for PSP and were associated with	17q21.31; Copy number variation (CNV); H1 and H2 haplotypes; MAPT; Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)

Genetic associations with dementia-related proteinopathy: Application of item response theory.	Although dementia-related proteinopathy has a strong negative impact on public health, and is highly heritable, understanding of the related genetic architecture is incomplete. We applied multidimensional generalized partial credit modeling (GPCM) to test genetic associations with dementia-related proteinopathies. Data were analyzed to identify candidate single nucleotide variants for the following proteinopathies: Aβ, tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43. Final included data comprised 966 participants with neuropathologic and WGS data. Three continuous latent outcomes were constructed, corresponding to TDP-43-, Aβ/Tau-, and α-synuclein-related neuropathology endophenotype scores. This approach helped validate known genotype/phenotype associations: for example, TMEM106B and GRN were risk alleles for TDP-43 pathology; and GBA for α-synuclein/Lewy bodies. Novel suggestive proteinopathy-linked alleles were also discovered, including several (SDHAF1, TMEM68, and ARHGEF28) with colocalization analyses and/or high degrees of biologic credibility. A novel methodology using GPCM enabled insights into gene candidates for driving misfolded proteinopathies. Latent factor scores for proteinopathies were estimated using a generalized partial credit model. The three latent continuous scores corresponded well with proteinopathy severity. Novel genes associated with proteinopathies were identified. Several genes had high degrees of biologic credibility for dementia risk factors.

Interrupted mosaic speech revisited: Gain and loss in intelligibility by stretchinga).	"Our previous investigation on the effect of stretching spectrotemporally degraded and temporally interrupted speech stimuli showed remarkable intelligibility gains [Udea, Takeichi, and Wakamiya (2022). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 152(2), 970-980]. In this previous study, however, gap durations and temporal resolution were confounded. In the current investigation, we therefore observed the intelligibility of so-called mosaic speech while dissociating the effects of interruption and temporal resolution. The intelligibility of mosaic speech (20 frequency bands and 20 ms segment duration) declined from 95% to 78% and 33% by interrupting it with 20 and 80 ms gaps. Intelligibility improved, however, to 92% and 54% (14% and 21% gains for 20 and 80 ms gaps, respectively) by stretching mosaic segments to fill silent gaps (n = 21). By contrast, the intelligibility was impoverished to a minimum of 9% (7% loss) when stretching stimuli interrupted with 160 ms gaps. Explanations based on auditory grouping, modulation unmasking, or phonemic restoration may account for the intelligibility improvement by stretching, but not for the loss. The probability summation model accounted for ""U""-shaped intelligibility curves and the gain and loss of intelligibility, suggesting that perceptual unit length and speech rate may affect the intelligibility of spectrotemporally degraded speech stimuli."

A comparative study of structural variant calling in WGS from Alzheimer's disease families.	Detecting structural variants (SVs) in whole-genome sequencing poses significant challenges. We present a protocol for variant calling, merging, genotyping, sensitivity analysis, and laboratory validation for generating a high-quality SV call set in whole-genome sequencing from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project comprising 578 individuals from 111 families. Employing two complementary pipelines, Scalpel and Parliament, for SV/indel calling, we assessed sensitivity through sample replicates (N = 9) with in silico variant spike-ins. We developed a novel metric, D-score, to evaluate caller specificity for deletions. The accuracy of deletions was evaluated by Sanger sequencing. We generated a high-quality call set of 152,301 deletions of diverse sizes. Sanger sequencing validated 114 of 146 detected deletions (78.1%). Scalpel excelled in accuracy for deletions ≤100 bp, whereas Parliament was optimal for deletions >900 bp. Overall, 83.0% and 72.5% of calls by Scalpel and Parliament were validated, respectively, including all 11 deletions called by both Parliament and Scalpel between 101 and 900 bp. Our flexible protocol successfully generated a high-quality deletion call set and a truth set of Sanger sequencing-validated deletions with precise breakpoints spanning 1-17,000 bp.

Sustainable planning: the case study of the Strait of Messina ports.	"The energy and environmental policy carried out by the Port System Authority of the Strait (AdSP), in charge of the management of the ports spread along the Strait of Messina, is reported. The Environmental and Energy Planning Document of Port Systems (DEASP, the Italian acronym) is the document explaining the AdSP sustainable strategy to reduce GHG emissions. It defines specific measures, in order to improve energy efficiency in buildings and infrastructures, promote the use of renewable energy in the port area, and confer environmental benefits for the citizens of neighboring territories and port users. The main actions developed are as follows: photovoltaic solar plants and tidal energy systems, electrification of the docks to allow the shore supply of ships, and the construction of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) storage plant to replace more polluting marine fuels, together with awareness campaigns on ""green"" issues, involving the 3 million users of these ports. Starting from the socio-economic and environmental analysis of the territorial context managed by AdSP, the DEASP analyses all the activities carried out inside port areas and reports the energy consumptions of the concessionaries, in the way to calculate the carbon footprint and develop an environmental sustainable strategy to reduce pollutant emissions. The interventions foreseen are assessed through the cost-benefit analysis and allow reducing the GHG emissions in 2030 up to 46%."

Association between lifestyle and dietary preference factors and conventional adenomas and serrated polyps.	Both conventional adenoma (AD) and serrated polyp (SP) were known precursor lesions of colorectal cancer (CRC). Modifiable lifestyle factors were significantly associated with CRC risk, but whether these factors were related to the risk of different precursors of CRC needed to be clarified. This study aimed to evaluate the risks of AD and SP caused by lifestyle factors and compare the risk differences between AD and SP. The study population was from the CRC screening cohort in Hangzhou, China. A total of 458,457 eligible individuals volunteered to undergo initial screening including the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and the CRC risk assessment. Finally, 13,993 participants who had undergone colonoscopy tests and had been diagnosed at designated hospitals were selected in this study. All participants were required to fill out a questionnaire during the initial screening for collecting their information. The generalized estimate equation (GEE) model was used to assess the association between lifestyle factors/dietary preferences and AD/SP. The body mass index (BMI) and smoking were positively associated with the risks of only SP (BMI: OR = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.23-1.84; smoking: OR = 1.29, 95%CI: 1.07-1.55), only AD (BMI: OR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.28-1.82; OR = 1.24, 95%CI: 1.11-1.39), and synchronous SP and AD (BMI: OR = 1.97, 95%CI: 1.40-2.75; smoking: OR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.27-1.85). In the case-group comparison, smoking was more strongly associated with the risk of synchronous SP and AD than only AD. Alcohol drinking was positively associated with the risk of AD (OR = 1.28, 95%CI: 1.14-1.44), but no statistically significant difference was observed in risks in the case-group comparison. Furthermore, whole-grain intake was associated with a decreased risk of only AD (OR = 0.78, 95%CI: 0.65-0.93). However, white meat intake was positively associated with risks of only SP when compared with AD cases (OR = 1.60, 95%CI: 1.15-2.23). The current study identified common risk factors such as BMI and smoking as well as different risks of certain factors (e.g., alcohol drinking and whole-grain intake) for SP and AD. However, there were still some factors, especially diet-related factors, that have not been fully elucidated in their association with the two lesions. Further research is needed in future to confirm and develop prevention strategies for different lesions.	colorectal cancer; conventional adenomas; diet; modifiable lifestyle factors; serrated polyps

Human whole-exome genotype data for Alzheimer's disease.	The heterogeneity of the whole-exome sequencing (WES) data generation methods present a challenge to a joint analysis. Here we present a bioinformatics strategy for joint-calling 20,504 WES samples collected across nine studies and sequenced using ten capture kits in fourteen sequencing centers in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. The joint-genotype called variant-called format (VCF) file contains only positions within the union of capture kits. The VCF was then processed specifically to account for the batch effects arising from the use of different capture kits from different studies. We identified 8.2 million autosomal variants. 96.82% of the variants are high-quality, and are located in 28,579 Ensembl transcripts. 41% of the variants are intronic and 1.8% of the variants are with CADD > 30, indicating they are of high predicted pathogenicity. Here we show our new strategy can generate high-quality data from processing these diversely generated WES samples. The improved ability to combine data sequenced in different batches benefits the whole genomics research community.

Report of the APOE4 National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project Consortium Working Group: Reducing APOE4 in Carriers is a Therapeutic Goal for Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. The apolipoprotein E4 gene (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. In 2023, the APOE4 National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project working group came together to gather data and discuss the question of whether to reduce or increase APOE4 as a therapeutic intervention for AD. It was the unanimous consensus that cumulative data from multiple studies in humans and animal models support that lowering APOE4 should be a target for therapeutic approaches for APOE4 carriers.

The aberrant glucose circadian rhythm is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes. Similar to glucose metabolism in the kidney and liver, d-alanine, a rare enantiomer of alanine, shows circadian alteration, although the effect of d-alanine on glucose metabolism has not been explored. Here, we show that d-alanine acts on the circadian clock and affects glucose metabolism in the kidney. The blood and urinary levels of d-alanine in mice were measured using two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography system. Metabolic effects of d-alanine were analyzed in mice and in primary culture of kidney proximal tubular cells from mice. Behavioral and gene expression analyses of circadian rhythm were performed using mice bred under constant darkness. d-Alanine levels in blood exhibited a clear intrinsic circadian rhythm. Since this rhythm was regulated by the kidney through urinary excretion, we examined the effect of d-alanine on the kidney. In the kidney, d-alanine induced the expressions of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and circadian rhythm. Treatment of d-alanine mediated glucose production in mice. d-Alanine induces gluconeogenesis in the kidney and adjusts the period of the circadian clock. Normalization of circadian cycle by d-alanine may provide the therapeutic options for life style–related diseases and shift workers.

Longitudinal change in memory performance as a strong endophenotype for Alzheimer's disease.	Although large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted on AD, few have been conducted on continuous measures of memory performance and memory decline. We conducted a cross-ancestry GWAS on memory performance (in 27,633 participants) and memory decline (in 22,365 participants; 129,201 observations) by leveraging harmonized cognitive data from four aging cohorts. We found high heritability for two ancestry backgrounds. Further, we found a novel ancestry locus for memory decline on chromosome 4 (rs6848524) and three loci in the non-Hispanic Black ancestry group for memory performance on chromosomes 2 (rs111471504), 7 (rs4142249), and 15 (rs74381744). In our gene-level analysis, we found novel genes for memory decline on chromosomes 1 (SLC25A44), 11 (BSX), and 15 (DPP8). Memory performance and memory decline shared genetic architecture with AD-related traits, neuropsychiatric traits, and autoimmune traits. We discovered several novel loci, genes, and genetic correlations associated with late-life memory performance and decline. Late-life memory has high heritability that is similar across ancestries. We discovered four novel variants associated with late-life memory. We identified four novel genes associated with late-life memory. Late-life memory shares genetic architecture with psychiatric/autoimmune traits.	Alzheimer's disease; GWAS; genetics; memory

Sex-specific genetic architecture of late-life memory performance.	Women demonstrate a memory advantage when cognitively healthy yet lose this advantage to men in Alzheimer's disease. However, the genetic underpinnings of this sex difference in memory performance remain unclear. We conducted the largest sex-aware genetic study on late-life memory to date (N We identified three sex-specific loci (rs67099044-CBLN2, rs719070-SCHIP1/IQCJ-SCHIP), including an X-chromosome locus (rs5935633-EGL6/TCEANC/OFD1), that associated with memory. Additionally, we identified heparan sulfate signaling as a sex-specific pathway and found sex-specific genetic correlations between memory and cardiovascular, immune, and education traits. This study showed memory is highly and comparably heritable across sexes, as well as highlighted novel sex-specific genes, pathways, and genetic correlations that related to late-life memory. Demonstrated the heritable component of late-life memory is similar across sexes. Identified two genetic loci with a sex-interaction with baseline memory. Identified an X-chromosome locus associated with memory decline in females. Highlighted sex-specific candidate genes and pathways associated with memory. Revealed sex-specific shared genetic architecture between memory and complex traits.	Alzheimer's disease; GWAS; Genomics; aging; cognition; endophenotypes; memory; sex differences; sex-specific

Prior studies using the ADSP data examined variants within presenilin-2 (PSEN2), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes. However, previously-reported clinically-relevant variants and other predicted damaging missense (DM) variants have not been characterized in a newer release of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). To characterize previously-reported clinically-relevant variants and DM variants in PSEN2, PSEN1, APP within the participants from the ADSP. We identified rare variants (MAF <1%) previously-reported in PSEN2, PSEN1, and APP in the available ADSP sample of 14,641 individuals with whole genome sequencing and 16,849 individuals with whole exome sequencing available for research-use (Ntotal = 31,490). We additionally curated variants in these three genes from ClinVar, OMIM, and Alzforum and report carriers of variants in clinical databases as well as predicted DM variants in these genes. We detected 31 previously-reported clinically-relevant variants with alternate alleles observed within the ADSP: 4 variants in PSEN2, 25 in PSEN1, and 2 in APP. The overall variant carrier rate for the 31 clinically-relevant variants in the ADSP was 0.3%. We observed that 79.5% of the variant carriers were cases compared to 3.9% were controls. In those with AD, the mean age of onset of AD among carriers of these clinically-relevant variants was 19.6 ± 1.4 years earlier compared with noncarriers (p-value=7.8×10-57). A small proportion of individuals in the ADSP are carriers of a previously-reported clinically-relevant variant allele for AD and these participants have significantly earlier age of AD onset compared to noncarriers.

Genetic analyses in multiplex families confirms chromosome 5q35 as a risk locus for Alzheimer's Disease in individuals of African Ancestry.	There is a paucity of genetic studies of Alzheimer Disease (AD) in individuals of African Ancestry, despite evidence suggesting increased risk of AD in the African American (AA) population. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and multipoint linkage analyses in 51 multi-generational AA AD families ascertained through the Research in African American Alzheimer Disease Initiative (REAAADI) and the National Institute on Aging Late Onset Alzheimer's disease (NIA-LOAD) Family Based Study. Variants were prioritized on minor allele frequency (<0.01), functional potential of coding and noncoding variants, co-segregation with AD and presence in multi-ancestry ADSP release 3 WGS data. We identified a significant linkage signal on chromosome 5q35 (HLOD=3.3) driven by nine families. Haplotype segregation analysis in the family with highest LOD score identified a 3'UTR variant in INSYN2B with the most functional evidence. Four other linked AA families harbor within-family shared variants located in INSYN2B's promoter or enhancer regions. This AA family-based finding shows the importance of diversifying population-level genetic data to better understand the genetic determinants of AD on a global scale.

NIAGADS Alzheimer's GenomicsDB: A resource for exploring Alzheimer's disease genetic and genomic knowledge.	The National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site Alzheimer's Genomics Database (GenomicsDB) is a public knowledge base of Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic datasets and genomic annotations. GenomicsDB uses a custom systems architecture to adopt and enforce rigorous standards that facilitate harmonization of AD-relevant genome-wide association study summary statistics datasets with functional annotations, including over 230 million annotated variants from the AD Sequencing Project. GenomicsDB generates interactive reports compiled from the harmonized datasets and annotations. These reports contextualize AD-risk associations in a broader functional genomic setting and summarize them in the context of functionally annotated genes and variants. Created to make AD-genetics knowledge more accessible to AD researchers, the GenomicsDB is designed to guide users unfamiliar with genetic data in not only exploring but also interpreting this ever-growing volume of data. Scalable and interoperable with other genomics resources using data technology standards, the GenomicsDB can serve as a central hub for research and data analysis on AD and related dementias. The National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) offers to the public a unique, disease-centric collection of AD-relevant GWAS summary statistics datasets. Interpreting these data is challenging and requires significant bioinformatics expertise to standardize datasets and harmonize them with functional annotations on genome-wide scales. The NIAGADS Alzheimer's GenomicsDB helps overcome these challenges by providing a user-friendly public knowledge base for AD-relevant genetics that shares harmonized, annotated summary statistics datasets from the NIAGADS repository in an interpretable, easily searchable format.

Checkerboard and interrupted speech: Intelligibility contrasts related to factor-analysis-based frequency bandsa).	It has been shown that the intelligibility of checkerboard speech stimuli, in which speech signals were periodically interrupted in time and frequency, drastically varied according to the combination of the number of frequency bands (2-20) and segment duration (20-320 ms). However, the effects of the number of frequency bands between 4 and 20 and the frequency division parameters on intelligibility have been largely unknown. Here, we show that speech intelligibility was lowest in four-band checkerboard speech stimuli, except for the 320-ms segment duration. Then, temporally interrupted speech stimuli and eight-band checkerboard speech stimuli came in this order (N = 19 and 20). At the same time, U-shaped intelligibility curves were observed for four-band and possibly eight-band checkerboard speech stimuli. Furthermore, different parameters of frequency division resulted in small but significant intelligibility differences at the 160- and 320-ms segment duration in four-band checkerboard speech stimuli. These results suggest that factor-analysis-based four frequency bands, representing groups of critical bands correlating with each other in speech power fluctuations, work as speech cue channels essential for speech perception. Moreover, a probability summation model for perceptual units, consisting of a sub-unit process and a supra-unit process that receives outputs of the speech cue channels, may account for the U-shaped intelligibility curves.

ADSP: An adaptive sample pooling strategy for diagnostic testing.	We often must conduct diagnostic tests on a massive volume of samples within a limited time during outbreaks of infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19,screening) or repeat many times routinely (e.g., regular and massive screening for plant virus infections in farms). These tests aim to obtain the diagnostic result of all samples within a limited time. In such scenarios, the limitation of testing resources and human labor drives the need to pool individual samples and test them together to improve testing efficiency. When a pool is positive, further testing is required to identify the affected individuals; whereas when a pool is negative, we conclude all individuals in the pool are negative. How one splits the samples into pools is a critical factor affecting testing efficiency. We aim to find the optimal strategy that adaptively guides users on optimally splitting the sample cohort into test-pools. We developed an algorithm that minimizes the expected number of tests needed to obtain the diagnostic results of all samples. Our algorithm dynamically updates the critical information according to the result of the most recent test and calculates the optimal pool size for the next test. We implemented our novel adaptive sample pooling strategy into a web-based application, ADSP (https://ADSP.uvic.ca). ADSP interactively guides users on how many samples to be pooled for the current test, asks users to report the test result back and uses it to update the best strategy on how many samples to be pooled for the next test. We compared ADSP with other popular pooling methods in simulation studies, and found that ADSP requires fewer tests to diagnose a cohort and is more robust to the inaccurate initial estimate of the test cohort's disease prevalence. Our web-based application can help researchers decide how to pool their samples for grouped diagnostic tests. It improves test efficiency when grouped tests are conducted.

Overestimated prediction using polygenic prediction derived from summary statistics.	When polygenic risk score (PRS) is derived from summary statistics, independence between discovery and test sets cannot be monitored. We compared two types of PRS studies derived from raw genetic data (denoted as rPRS) and the summary statistics for IGAP (sPRS). Two variables with the high heritability in UK Biobank, hypertension, and height, are used to derive an exemplary scale effect of PRS. sPRS without APOE is derived from International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), which records ΔAUC and ΔR Considering the high heritability of hypertension and height of UK Biobank and sample size of UK Biobank, sPRS results from AD databases are inflated. Independence between discovery and test sets is a well-known basic requirement for PRS studies. However, a lot of PRS studies cannot follow such requirements because of impossible direct comparisons when using summary statistics. Thus, for sPRS, potential duplications should be carefully considered within the same ethnic group.	Alzheimer’s disease; Complex genetic disease; Overestimation bias; Polygenic risk score

Key variants via Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project whole genome sequence data.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but did not identify specific causal genes or variants within those loci. Analysis of whole genome sequence (WGS) data, which interrogates the entire genome and captures rare variations, may identify causal variants within GWAS loci. We performed single common variant association analysis and rare variant aggregate analyses in the pooled population (N cases=2,184, N controls=2,383) and targeted analyses in sub-populations using WGS data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). The analyses were restricted to variants within 100 kb of 83 previously identified GWAS lead variants. Seventeen variants were significantly associated with AD within five genomic regions implicating the genes OARD1/NFYA/TREML1, JAZF1, FERMT2, and SLC24A4. KAT8 was implicated by both single variant and rare variant aggregate analyses. This study demonstrates the utility of leveraging WGS to gain insights into AD loci identified via GWAS.

NOTCH3 C201R variant causes cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) that can be confused with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.	NOTCH3 is the causative gene for autosomal dominant cerebral arteriopathy with subcortical infarctions and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) which is associated with both stroke and dementia. When CADASIL presents primarily as dementia it can be difficult to distinguish from Alzheimer's disease (AD) at both the clinical and neuropathological levels. We performed exome sequencing of several affected individuals from a large family affected with AD. PCR amplification and direct Sanger sequencing were used to verify variants detected by exome analysis and to screen family members at-risk to carry those variants. Neuropathologic brain evaluation by immunohistochemistry and MRI were performed for the carriers of the NOTCH3 variant. In a three-generation family with AD, we found a c.601 T > C p.Cys201Arg variant in the NOTCH3 gene that caused clinical and neuropathological manifestations of CADASIL. These features included earlier onset of dementia accompanied by behavioral abnormalities in the father and son and white matter abnormalities in the asymptomatic grandson. The family is one branch of a large pedigree studied by the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). As part of the ADSP linkage analysis and whole genome sequencing endeavor, an ABCA1 variant, p.Ala937Val, was previously found associated with AD in this pedigree. Our findings, together with other reported pathogenic missense variants of the C201 codon in NOTCH3, support the role of cysteine 201 as a mutation hotspot for CADASIL and highlight the genetic complexity both clinically and pathologically of AD and related dementia.

Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers are associated with cognitive function and dementia: Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort.	Inflammatory protein biomarkers induced by immune responses have been associated with cognitive decline and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigate associations between a panel of inflammatory biomarkers and cognitive function and incident dementia outcomes in the well-characterized Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort. Participants aged ≥40 years and dementia-free at Exam 7 who had a stored plasma sample were selected for profiling using the OLINK proteomics inflammation panel. Cross-sectional associations of the biomarkers with cognitive domain scores (N = 708, 53% female, 22% apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers, 15% APOE ε2 carriers, mean age 61) and incident all-cause and AD dementia during up to 20 years of follow-up were tested. APOE genotype-stratified analyses were performed to explore effect modification. Higher levels of 12 and 3 proteins were associated with worse executive function and language domain factor scores, respectively. Several proteins were associated with more than one cognitive domain, including IL10, LIF-R, TWEAK, CCL19, IL-17C, MCP-4, and TGF-alpha. Stratified analyses suggested differential effects between APOE ε2 and ε4 carriers: most ε4 carrier associations were with executive function and memory domains, whereas most ε2 associations were with the visuospatial domain. Higher levels of TNFB and CDCP1 were associated with higher risks of incident all-cause and AD dementia. Our study found that TWEAK concentration was associated both with cognitive function and risks for AD dementia. The association of these inflammatory biomarkers with cognitive function and incident dementia may contribute to the discovery of therapeutic interventions for the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline.

DNA from multiple viral species is associated with Alzheimer's disease risk.	Multiple infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk by independent lines of evidence. We explored this association by comparing the frequencies of viral species identified in a large sample of AD cases and controls. DNA sequence reads that did not align to the human genome in sequences were mapped to viral reference sequences, quantified, and then were tested for association with AD in whole exome sequences (WES) and whole genome sequences (WGS) datasets. Several viruses were significant predictors of AD according to the machine learning classifiers. Subsequent regression analyses showed that herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) (odds ratio [OR] = 3.71, p = 8.03 × 10-4) and human papillomavirus 71 (HPV-71; OR = 3.56, p = 0.02), were significantly associated with AD after Bonferroni correction. The phylogenetic-related cluster of Herpesviridae was significantly associated with AD in several strata of the data (p < 0.01). Our results support the hypothesis that viral infection, especially HSV-1, is associated with AD risk.

Multifunctional acetylated distarch phosphate based conducting hydrogel with high stretchability, ultralow hysteresis and fast response for wearable strain sensors.	"The rapid development of flexible sensors has greatly increased the demand for high-performance hydrogels. However, it remains a challenge to fabricate flexible hydrogel sensors with high stretching, low hysteresis, excellent adhesion, good conductivity, sensing characteristics and bacteriostatic function in a simple way. Herein, a highly conducting double network hydrogel is presented by incorporating lithium chloride (LiCl) into the hydrogel consisting of poly (2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid/acrylamide/acrylic acid) (3A) network and acetylated distarch phosphate (ADSP). The addition of ADSP not only formed hydrogen bonds with 3A to improve the toughness of the hydrogel but also plays the role of ""physical cross-linking"" in 3A by ""anchoring"" the polymer molecular chains together. Tuning the composition of the hydrogel allows the attainment of the best functions, such as high stretchability (∼770 %), ultralow hysteresis (2.2 %, ε = 100 %), excellent electrical conductivity (2.9 S/m), strain sensitivity (GF = 3.0 at 200-500 % strain) and fast response (96 ms). Based on the above performance, the 3A/ADSP/LiCl hydrogel strain sensor can repeatedly and stably detect and monitor large-scale human movements and subtle sensing signals. In addition, the 3A/ADSP/LiCl hydrogel shows a good biocompatibility and bacteriostatic ability. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing the conductive hydrogels for wearable devices and flexible sensors."

Associations of Sex, Race, and Apolipoprotein E Alleles With Multiple Domains of Cognition Among Older Adults.	Sex differences are established in associations between apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, it is unclear whether sex-specific cognitive consequences of APOE are consistent across races and extend to the APOE ε2 allele. To investigate whether sex and race modify APOE ε4 and ε2 associations with cognition. This genetic association study included longitudinal cognitive data from 4 AD and cognitive aging cohorts. Participants were older than 60 years and self-identified as non-Hispanic White or non-Hispanic Black (hereafter, White and Black). Data were previously collected across multiple US locations from 1994 to 2018. Secondary analyses began December 2021 and ended September 2022. Harmonized composite scores for memory, executive function, and language were generated using psychometric approaches. Linear regression assessed interactions between APOE ε4 or APOE ε2 and sex on baseline cognitive scores, while linear mixed-effect models assessed interactions on cognitive trajectories. The intersectional effect of race was modeled using an APOE × sex × race interaction term, assessing whether APOE × sex interactions differed by race. Models were adjusted for age at baseline and corrected for multiple comparisons. Of 32 427 participants who met inclusion criteria, there were 19 007 females (59%), 4453 Black individuals (14%), and 27 974 White individuals (86%); the mean (SD) age at baseline was 74 years (7.9). At baseline, 6048 individuals (19%) had AD, 4398 (14%) were APOE ε2 carriers, and 12 538 (38%) were APOE ε4 carriers. Participants missing APOE status were excluded (n = 9266). For APOE ε4, a robust sex interaction was observed on baseline memory (β = -0.071, SE = 0.014; P = 9.6 × 10-7), whereby the APOE ε4 negative effect was stronger in females compared with males and did not significantly differ among races. Contrastingly, despite the large sample size, no APOE ε2 × sex interactions on cognition were observed among all participants. When testing for intersectional effects of sex, APOE ε2, and race, an interaction was revealed on baseline executive function among individuals who were cognitively unimpaired (β = -0.165, SE = 0.066; P = .01), whereby the APOE ε2 protective effect was female-specific among White individuals but male-specific among Black individuals. In this study, while race did not modify sex differences in APOE ε4, the APOE ε2 protective effect could vary by race and sex. Although female sex enhanced ε4-associated risk, there was no comparable sex difference in ε2, suggesting biological pathways underlying ε4-associated risk are distinct from ε2 and likely intersect with age-related changes in sex biology.

The Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Whole-Genome Sequencing Project: Study design and methodology.	Sequencing efforts to identify genetic variants and pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) have largely focused on late-onset AD although early-onset AD (EOAD), accounting for ∼10% of cases, is largely unexplained by known mutations, resulting in a lack of understanding of its molecular etiology. Whole-genome sequencing and harmonization of clinical, neuropathological, and biomarker data of over 5000 EOAD cases of diverse ancestries. A publicly available genomics resource for EOAD with extensive harmonized phenotypes. Primary analysis will (1) identify novel EOAD risk loci and druggable targets; (2) assess local-ancestry effects; (3) create EOAD prediction models; and (4) assess genetic overlap with cardiovascular and other traits. This novel resource complements over 50,000 control and late-onset AD samples generated through the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). The harmonized EOAD/ADSP joint call will be available through upcoming ADSP data releases and will allow for additional analyses across the full onset range. Sequencing efforts to identify genetic variants and pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) have largely focused on late-onset AD although early-onset AD (EOAD), accounting for ∼10% of cases, is largely unexplained by known mutations. This results in a significant lack of understanding of the molecular etiology of this devastating form of the disease. The Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Whole-genome Sequencing Project is a collaborative initiative to generate a large-scale genomics resource for early-onset Alzheimer's disease with extensive harmonized phenotype data. Primary analyses are designed to (1) identify novel EOAD risk and protective loci and druggable targets; (2) assess local-ancestry effects; (3) create EOAD prediction models; and (4) assess genetic overlap with cardiovascular and other traits. The harmonized genomic and phenotypic data from this initiative will be available through NIAGADS.

Predicting dry weight change in Hemodialysis patients using machine learning.	Machine Learning has been increasingly used in the medical field, including managing patients undergoing hemodialysis. The random forest classifier is a Machine Learning method that can generate high accuracy and interpretability in the data analysis of various diseases. We attempted to apply Machine Learning to adjust dry weight, the appropriate volume status of patients undergoing hemodialysis, which requires a complex decision-making process considering multiple indicators and the patient's physical conditions. All medical data and 69,375 dialysis records of 314 Asian patients undergoing hemodialysis at a single dialysis center in Japan between July 2018 and April 2020 were collected from the electronic medical record system. Using the random forest classifier, we developed models to predict the probabilities of adjusting the dry weight at each dialysis session. The areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves of the models for adjusting the dry weight upward and downward were 0.70 and 0.74, respectively. The average probability of upward adjustment of the dry weight had sharp a peak around the actual change over time, while the average probability of downward adjustment of the dry weight formed a gradual peak. Feature importance analysis revealed that median blood pressure decline was a strong predictor for adjusting the dry weight upward. In contrast, elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein and hypoalbuminemia were important indicators for adjusting the dry weight downward. The random forest classifier should provide a helpful guide to predict the optimal changes to the dry weight with relative accuracy and may be useful in clinical practice.

Admixture mapping implicates 13q33.3 as ancestry-of-origin locus for Alzheimer disease in Hispanic and Latino populations.	Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of senile dementia, with high incidence late in life in many populations including Caribbean Hispanic (CH) populations. Such admixed populations, descended from more than one ancestral population, can present challenges for genetic studies, including limited sample sizes and unique analytical constraints. Therefore, CH populations and other admixed populations have not been well represented in studies of AD, and much of the genetic variation contributing to AD risk in these populations remains unknown. Here, we conduct genome-wide analysis of AD in multiplex CH families from the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). We developed, validated, and applied an implementation of a logistic mixed model for admixture mapping with binary traits that leverages genetic ancestry to identify ancestry-of-origin loci contributing to AD. We identified three loci on chromosome 13q33.3 associated with reduced risk of AD, where associations were driven by Native American (NAM) ancestry.

A questionnaire to measure direct support professionals' attitude towards healthy nutrition of people with intellectual disabilities.	Direct support professionals' (DSPs') attitudes toward nutrition are important for supporting a healthy lifestyle of persons with intellectual disabilities. However, there are no instruments to measure it. The aim of this study was to compose a questionnaire and determine its internal validity. The previously validated Health Enhancing Physical Activity questionnaire was adapted into the Attitude of DSPs for Health Enhancing Nutrition (ADSP-HENU) and completed by 31 DSPs. The internal validity of the questionnaire was investigated by Cronbach's Alpha and an exploratory non-parametric item response analysis (NIRT). The internal consistency by Cronbach's Alpha was good (0.87, 95% CI [0.81-0.94]). NIRT showed monotonicity with wide confidence bounds and sufficient point polyserial correlations of the items. This indicates that each attributes to the overall measured attitude. The internal validity of the ADSP-HENU is promising, and it can be used in daily practice for evaluation or adapting interventions to DSPs' needs.

Functional variants identify sex-specific genes and pathways in Alzheimer's Disease.	The incidence of Alzheimer's Disease in females is almost double that of males. To search for sex-specific gene associations, we build a machine learning approach focused on functionally impactful coding variants. This method can detect differences between sequenced cases and controls in small cohorts. In the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project with mixed sexes, this approach identified genes enriched for immune response pathways. After sex-separation, genes become specifically enriched for stress-response pathways in male and cell-cycle pathways in female. These genes improve disease risk prediction in silico and modulate Drosophila neurodegeneration in vivo. Thus, a general approach for machine learning on functionally impactful variants can uncover sex-specific candidates towards diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Machine-learning predicts time-series prognosis factors in metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy.	Machine learning technology is expected to support diagnosis and prognosis prediction in medicine. We used machine learning to construct a new prognostic prediction model for prostate cancer patients based on longitudinal data obtained from age at diagnosis, peripheral blood and urine tests of 340 prostate cancer patients. Random survival forest (RSF) and survival tree were used for machine learning. In the time-series prognostic prediction model for metastatic prostate cancer patients, the RSF model showed better prediction accuracy than the conventional Cox proportional hazards model for almost all time periods of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Based on the RSF model, we created a clinically applicable prognostic prediction model using survival trees for OS and CSS by combining the values of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) before starting treatment and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 120 days after treatment. Machine learning provides useful information for predicting the prognosis of metastatic prostate cancer prior to treatment intervention by considering the nonlinear and combined impacts of multiple features. The addition of data after the start of treatment would allow for more precise prognostic risk assessment of patients and would be beneficial for subsequent treatment selection.

Visual and haptic cues in processing occlusion.	Although shape is effective in processing occlusion, ambiguities in segmentation can also be addressed using depth discontinuity given visually and haptically. This study elucidates the contribution of visual and haptic cues to depth discontinuity in processing occlusion. A virtual reality experiment was conducted with 15 students as participants. Word stimuli were presented on a head-mounted display for recognition. The central part of the words was masked with a virtual ribbon placed at different depths so that the ribbon appeared as an occlusion. The visual depth cue was either present with binocular stereopsis or absent with monocular presentation. The haptic cue was either missing, provided consecutively, or concurrently, by actively tracing a real off-screen bar edge that was positionally aligned with the ribbon in the virtual space. Recognition performance was compared between depth cue conditions. We found that word recognition was better with the stereoscopic cue but not with the haptic cue, although both cues contributed to greater confidence in depth estimation. The performance was better when the ribbon was at the farther depth plane to appear as a hollow, rather than when it was at the nearer depth plane to cover the word. The results indicate that occlusion is processed in the human brain by visual input only despite the apparent effectiveness of haptic space perception, reflecting a complex set of natural constraints.	depth cues; haptic perception; image segmentation; virtual reality; visual pathways

Machine learning approach to stratify complex heterogeneity of chronic heart failure: A report from the CHART-2 study.	Current approaches to classify chronic heart failure (HF) subpopulations may be limited due to the diversity of pathophysiology and co-morbidities in chronic HF. We aimed to elucidate the clusters of chronic patients with HF by data-driven approaches with machine learning in a hospital-based registry. A total of 4649 patients with a broad spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the CHART-2 (Chronic Heart Failure Analysis and Registry in the Tohoku District-2) study were enrolled to this study. Chronic HF patients were classified using random forest clustering with 56 multiscale clinical parameters. We assessed the influence of the clusters on cardiovascular death, non-cardiovascular death, all-cause death, and free from hospitalization by HF. Latent class analysis using random forest clustering identified 10 clusters with four primary components: cardiac function (LVEF, left atrial and ventricular diameters, diastolic blood pressure, and brain natriuretic peptide), renal function (glomerular filtration rate and blood urea nitrogen), anaemia (red blood cell, haematocrit, haemoglobin, and platelet count), and nutrition (albumin and body mass index). All 11 significant clinical parameters in the four primary components and two disease aetiologies (ischaemic heart disease and valvular heart disease) showed statistically significant differences among the 10 clusters (P < 0.01). Cluster 1 (26.7% of patients), which is characterized by preserved LVEF (<59%, 37% of the total) with lowest brain natriuretic peptide (>111.3 pg/mL, 0.9%) and lowest left atrial diameter (>42 mm, 37.4%), showed the best 5 year survival rate of 98.1% for cardiovascular death, 95.9% for non-cardiovascular death, 92.9% for all-cause death, and 91.7% for free from hospitalization by HF. Cluster 10 (6.0% of the total), which is co-morbid disorders of all four primary components, showed the worst survival rate of 39.1% for cardiovascular death, 68.9% for non-cardiovascular death, 23.9% for all-cause death, and 28.1% for free from hospitalization by HF. These results suggest the potential applicability of the machine leaning approach, providing useful clinical prognostic information to stratify complex heterogeneity in patients with HF.

Adipose-derived stem cell spheroid-laden microbial transglutaminase cross-linked gelatin hydrogel for treating diabetic periodontal wounds and craniofacial defects.	Diabetes mellitus deteriorates the destruction and impairs the healing of periodontal wounds and craniofacial defects. This study is to evaluate the potential of self-assembled adipose-derived stem cell spheroids (ADsp) in microbial transglutaminase cross-linked gelatin hydrogel (mTG) for treating diabetic periodontal wounds and craniofacial defects. Human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated by lipoaspiration, pluripotent genes and trilineage differentiation were examined, and the maintenance of ADsp properties in mTG was verified. Oral mucosal wounds and calvarial osseous defects were created in diabetic rats. Gross observation, histologic evaluation, and immunohistochemistry for proliferating cells and keratinization were conducted in the mucosal wounds within 4-28 days. Micro-CT imaging, histologic evaluation, and immunohistochemistry for proliferating cells and osteogenic differentiation were conducted in the osseous defects at 7 and 28 days. ADSCs expressed pluripotent genes and were capable of trilineage differentiation. ADsp retained morphology and stemness in mTG. In diabetic mucosal wounds, wound closure, epithelization, and keratinization were accelerated in those with ADsp and ADsp-mTG. In diabetic osseous defects, osteogenic differentiation markers were evidently expressed, cell proliferation was promoted from day 7, and bone formation was significantly promoted at day 28 in those with osteogenically pretreated ADsp-mTG. ADsp-mTG accelerated diabetic oral mucosal wound healing, and osteogenically pretreated ADsp-mTG promoted diabetic osseous defect regeneration, proving that ADsp-mTG facilitated diabetic periodontal wound healing and craniofacial osseous defect regeneration.

Supramolecular Exosome Array for Efficient Capture and In Situ Detection of Protein Biomarkers.	Exosomes are an emerging source for disease biomarker discovery due to the high stability of proteins protected by phospholipid bilayers. However, liquid biopsy with exosomes remains challenging due to the extreme complexity of biological samples. Herein, we introduced an amphiphile-dendrimer supramolecular probe (ADSP) for the efficient capture and high-throughput analysis of exosomes, enabling the array-based assay for marker proteins. Amphiphilic amphotericin B was functionalized onto highly branched globular dendrimers, which can then insert into the exosome membrane efficiently, forming a supramolecular complex through multivalent interactions between the probe and the bilayer of exosomes. The ADSP can be easily coated onto magnetic beads or the nitrocellulose membrane, facilitating the capture of exosomes from a minimum amount of clinical samples. The captured exosomes can be detected with target protein antibodies via Western blotting or in a high-throughput array-based dot blotting format. This new strategy exhibited excellent extraction capability from trace body fluids with superior sensitivity (less than 1 μL plasma), good quantitation ability (

This study used admixture mapping to prioritize the genetic regions associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in African American (AA) individuals, followed by ancestry-aware regression analysis to fine-map the prioritized regions. We analyzed 10,271 individuals from 17 different AA datasets. We performed admixture mapping and meta-analyzed the results. We then used regression analysis, adjusting for local ancestry main effects and interactions with genotype, to refine the regions identified from admixture mapping. Finally, we leveraged in silico annotation and differential gene expression data to prioritize AD-related variants and genes. Admixture mapping identified two genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 17p13.2 (p = 2.2 × 10 Our ancestry-aware regression approach showed that AA individuals have a lower risk of AD if they inherited African ancestry admixture block at the 17p13.2 locus. We identified two genome-wide significant admixture mapping signals: on chromosomes 17p13.2 and 18q21.33, which are novel in African American (AA) populations. Our ancestry-aware regression approach showed that AA individuals have a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) if they inherited African ancestry admixture block at the 17p13.2 locus. We found that the overall proportion of African ancestry does not differ between the cases and controls that suggest African genetic ancestry alone is not likely to explain the AD prevalence difference between AA and non-Hispanic White populations.

MicroRNA-874 targets phosphomevalonate kinase and inhibits cancer cell growth via the mevalonate pathway.	The microRNA (miR) miR-874, a potential tumour suppressor, causes cell death via target gene suppression in various cancer types. Mevalonate pathway inhibition also causes cell death in breast cancer. However, the relationship between the mevalonate pathway and miR-874-induced apoptosis or its association with the tumour suppressor p53 has not been elucidated. We identified phosphomevalonate kinase (PMVK), a key mevalonate pathway enzyme, and sterol regulatory element-binding factor 2 (SREBF2), the master cholesterol biosynthesis regulator, as direct miR‑874 targets. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed a significant miR-874-mediated downregulation of PMVK and SREBF2 gene expression and p53 pathway enrichment. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-874 directly regulated PMVK and SREBF2. miR-874-induced apoptosis was p53 dependent, and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that miR-874 transfection resulted in apoptosis and p53 pathway activation. Downregulation of PMVK expression also caused cell cycle arrest and p53 pathway activation, which was rescued by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) supplementation. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database indicated a negative correlation between miR-874 and PMVK expression and between miR-874 and SREBF2 expression. These findings suggest that miR-874 suppresses the mevalonate pathway by targeting SREBF2 and PMVK, resulting in GGPP depletion, which activates the p53 pathway and promotes cycle arrest or apoptosis.

Acetylated Distarch Phosphate-Mediated Tough and Conductive Hydrogel for Antibacterial Wearable Sensors.	Conductive, stretchable, and flexible hydrogel wearable sensors have attracted extensive attention in the fields of artificial intelligence and electronic equipment. However, it is an enormous challenge to fabricate conductive hydrogel sensors with biocompatibility, antibacterial properties, and toughness. Here, a highly conductive hydrogel with excellent toughness, good biocompatibility, and strong antibacterial properties was prepared by incorporating acetylated distarch phosphate (ADSP) into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/polyhexamethylene biguanide hydrochloride (PHMG). The addition of ADSP not only ionized sodium ions to make the hydrogel conductive but also provided abundant hydroxyl groups to form hydrogen bonds with PVA to improve the toughness of the hydrogel. Furthermore, PHMG endowed the hydrogel with antibacterial properties toward	Gram-negative bacteria; Gram-positive bacteria; acetylated distarch phosphate; hydrogel; wearable sensor

"The classic pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (AD neuropathologic changes, or ADNC). However, brains from individuals clinically diagnosed with ""AD-type"" (amnestic) dementia usually harbor heterogeneous neuropathologies in addition to, or other than, ADNC. We hypothesized that some AD-type dementia associated genetic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified from large genomewide association studies (GWAS) were associated with non-ADNC neuropathologies. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from multiple studies with available genotype and neuropathologic phenotype information. Clinical AD/dementia risk alleles of interest were derived from the very large GWAS by Bellenguez et al. (2022) who reported 83 clinical AD/dementia-linked SNVs in addition to the APOE risk alleles. To query the pathologic phenotypes associated with variation of those SNVs, National Alzheimer's disease Coordinating Center (NACC) neuropathologic data were linked to AD Sequencing Project (ADSP) and AD Genomics Consortium (ADGC) data. Separate data were obtained from the harmonized Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). A total of 4811 European participants had at least ADNC neuropathology data and also genotype data available; data were meta-analyzed across cohorts. As expected, a subset of dementia-associated SNVs were associated with ADNC risk in Europeans-e.g., BIN1, PICALM, CR1, MME, and COX7C. Other gene variants linked to (clinical) AD dementia were associated with non-ADNC pathologies. For example, the associations of GRN and TMEM106B SNVs with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) were replicated. In addition, SNVs in TNIP1 and WNT3 previously reported as AD-related were instead associated with hippocampal sclerosis pathology. Some genotype/neuropathology association trends were not statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05 after correcting for multiple testing, but were intriguing. For example, variants in SORL1 and TPCN1 showed trends for association with LATE-NC whereas Lewy body pathology trended toward association with USP6NL and BIN1 gene variants. A smaller cohort of non-European subjects (n = 273, approximately one-half of whom were African-Americans) provided the basis for additional exploratory analyses. Overall, these findings were consistent with the hypothesis that some genetic variants linked to AD dementia risk exert their affect by influencing non-ADNC neuropathologies."

Detecting time-evolving phenotypic components of adverse reactions against BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine via non-negative tensor factorization.	Symptoms of adverse reactions to vaccines evolve over time, but traditional studies have focused only on the frequency and intensity of symptoms. Here, we attempt to extract the dynamic changes in vaccine adverse reaction symptoms as a small number of interpretable components by using non-negative tensor factorization. We recruited healthcare workers who received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine at Chiba University Hospital and collected information on adverse reactions using a smartphone/web-based platform. We analyzed the adverse-reaction data after each dose obtained for 1,516 participants who received two doses of vaccine. The non-negative tensor factorization revealed four time-evolving components that represent typical temporal patterns of adverse reactions for both doses. These components were differently associated with background factors and post-vaccine antibody titers. These results demonstrate that complex adverse reactions against vaccines can be explained by a limited number of time-evolving components identified by tensor factorization.

MATS: a novel multi-ancestry transcriptome-wide association study to account for heterogeneity in the effects of cis-regulated gene expression on complex traits.	The Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) is a widely used approach which integrates gene expression and Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) data to study the role of cis-regulated gene expression (GEx) in complex traits. However, the genetic architecture of GEx varies across populations, and recent findings point to possible ancestral heterogeneity in the effects of GEx on complex traits, which may be amplified in TWAS by modeling GEx as a function of cis-eQTLs. Here, we present a novel extension to TWAS to account for heterogeneity in the effects of cis-regulated GEx which are correlated with ancestry. Our proposed Multi-Ancestry TwaS (MATS) framework jointly analyzes samples from multiple populations and distinguishes between shared, ancestry-specific and/or subject-specific expression-trait associations. As such, MATS amplifies power to detect shared GEx associations over ancestry-stratified TWAS through increased sample sizes, and facilitates the detection of genes with subgroup-specific associations which may be masked by standard TWAS. Our simulations highlight the improved Type-I error conservation and power of MATS compared with competing approaches. Our real data applications to Alzheimer's disease (AD) case-control genotypes from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and continuous phenotypes from the UK Biobank (UKBB) identify a number of unique gene-trait associations which were not discovered through standard and/or ancestry-stratified TWAS. Ultimately, these findings promote MATS as a powerful method for detecting and estimating significant gene expression effects on complex traits within multi-ancestry cohorts and corroborates the mounting evidence for inter-population heterogeneity in gene-trait associations.

Auditory grouping is necessary to understand interrupted mosaic speech stimuli.	The intelligibility of interrupted speech stimuli has been known to be almost perfect when segment duration is shorter than 80 ms, which means that the interrupted segments are perceptually organized into a coherent stream under this condition. However, why listeners can successfully group the interrupted segments into a coherent stream has been largely unknown. Here, we show that the intelligibility for mosaic speech in which original speech was segmented in frequency and time and noise-vocoded with the average power in each unit was largely reduced by periodical interruption. At the same time, the intelligibility could be recovered by promoting auditory grouping of the interrupted segments by stretching the segments up to 40 ms and reducing the gaps, provided that the number of frequency bands was enough ( ≥ 4) and the original segment duration was equal to or less than 40 ms. The interruption was devastating for mosaic speech stimuli, very likely because the deprivation of periodicity and temporal fine structure with mosaicking prevented successful auditory grouping for the interrupted segments.

A Fast and Robust Strategy to Remove Variant-Level Artifacts in Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project Data.	Exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) are expected to be critical to further elucidate the missing genetic heritability of Alzheimer disease (AD) risk by identifying rare coding and/or noncoding variants that contribute to AD pathogenesis. In the United States, the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) has taken a leading role in sequencing AD-related samples at scale, with the resultant data being made publicly available to researchers to generate new insights into the genetic etiology of AD. To achieve sufficient power, the ADSP has adapted a study design where subsets of larger AD cohorts are collected and sequenced across multiple centers, using a variety of sequencing platforms. This approach may lead to variable variant quality across sequencing centers and/or platforms. In this study, we sought to implement and evaluate filters that can be applied fast to robustly remove variant-level artifacts in the ADSP data. We implemented a robust quality control procedure to handle ADSP data. We evaluated this procedure while performing exome-wide and genome-wide association analyses on AD risk using the latest ADSP whole ES (WES) and whole GS (WGS) data releases (NG00067.v5). We observed that many variants displayed large variation in allele frequencies across sequencing centers/platforms and contributed to spurious association signals with AD risk. We also observed that sequencing platform/center adjustment in association models could not fully account for these spurious signals. To address this issue, we designed and implemented variant filters that could capture and remove these center-specific/platform-specific artifactual variants. We derived a fast and robust approach to filter variants that represent sequencing center-related or platform-related artifacts underlying spurious associations with AD risk in ADSP WES and WGS data. This approach will be important to support future robust genetic association studies on ADSP data, as well as other studies with similar designs.

A locus at 19q13.31 significantly reduces the ApoE ε4 risk for Alzheimer's Disease in African Ancestry.	"African descent populations have a lower Alzheimer disease risk from ApoE ε4 compared to other populations. Ancestry analysis showed that the difference in risk between African and European populations lies in the ancestral genomic background surrounding the ApoE locus (local ancestry). Identifying the mechanism(s) of this protection could lead to greater insight into the etiology of Alzheimer disease and more personalized therapeutic intervention. Our objective is to follow up the local ancestry finding and identify the genetic variants that drive this risk difference and result in a lower risk for developing Alzheimer disease in African ancestry populations. We performed association analyses using a logistic regression model with the ApoE ε4 allele as an interaction term and adjusted for genome-wide ancestry, age, and sex. Discovery analysis included imputed SNP data of 1,850 Alzheimer disease and 4,331 cognitively intact African American individuals. We performed replication analyses on 63 whole genome sequenced Alzheimer disease and 648 cognitively intact Ibadan individuals. Additionally, we reproduced results using whole-genome sequencing of 273 Alzheimer disease and 275 cognitively intact admixed Puerto Rican individuals. A further comparison was done with SNP imputation from an additional 8,463 Alzheimer disease and 11,365 cognitively intact non-Hispanic White individuals. We identified a significant interaction between the ApoE ε4 allele and the SNP rs10423769_A allele, (β = -0.54,SE = 0.12,p-value = 7.50x10-6) in the discovery data set, and replicated this finding in Ibadan (β = -1.32,SE = 0.52,p-value = 1.15x10-2) and Puerto Rican (β = -1.27,SE = 0.64,p-value = 4.91x10-2) individuals. The non-Hispanic Whites analyses showed an interaction trending in the ""protective"" direction but failing to pass a 0.05 significance threshold (β = -1.51,SE = 0.84,p-value = 7.26x10-2). The presence of the rs10423769_A allele reduces the odds ratio for Alzheimer disease risk from 7.2 for ApoE ε4/ε4 carriers lacking the A allele to 2.1 for ApoE ε4/ε4 carriers with at least one A allele. This locus is located approximately 2 mB upstream of the ApoE locus, in a large cluster of pregnancy specific beta-1 glycoproteins on chromosome 19 and lies within a long noncoding RNA, ENSG00000282943. This study identified a new African-ancestry specific locus that reduces the risk effect of ApoE ε4 for developing Alzheimer disease. The mechanism of the interaction with ApoEε4 is not known but suggests a novel mechanism for reducing the risk for ε4 carriers opening the possibility for potential ancestry-specific therapeutic intervention."

Enteromorpha cellulose micro-nanofibrils/poly(vinyl alcohol) based composite films with excellent hydrophilic, mechanical properties and improved thermal stability.	This study presents the preparation of cellulose micro-nanofibrils (CMNFs) from Enteromorpha (EP) and the application in PVA/acetylated distarch phosphate (ADSP)/CMNFs composite films. The Micro-nano scale, hydrophilicity, and strong hydrogen bond characteristics of CMNFs prepared form EP by acid hydrolysis were confirmed through the granular statistics, XRD analysis and chemical structure analysis. With the addition of CMNFs, the ultimate tensile strength and elongation at break of composite films are increased by 42.4 % and 90.3 %. An original Weibull statistical analysis shows the impact of CMNFs' added amount on strength distribution and ultimate stress. SEM and polarizing microscope images show the CMNFs' dispersion state in that films is optimal, when their addition was to be 2 %-3 % of total dry weight of PVA/ADSP matrix， which is consistent with the results of Weibull modulus analysis. The main thermal weight-loss process of the composite film is divided into four stages, CMNFs can significantly increase the thermostability at 280 °C to 400 °C. The experiment of water contact angle and water vapor transmission rate of the composite films confirmed that CMNFs can improve films' hydrophilicity. This study provides basis for the preparation of hydrophilic CMNFs and mechanism of modification study PVA-based composites.

Biochemical Discrimination of the Down Syndrome-Related Metabolic and Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress Alterations from the Physiologic Age-Related Changes through the Targeted Metabolomic Analysis of Serum.	Down Syndrome (DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by an accelerated aging process, frequently associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies evidenced that DS patients have various metabolic anomalies, easily measurable in their serum samples, although values that were found in DS patients were compared with those of age-matched non-DS patients, thus hampering to discriminate the physiologic age-related changes of serum metabolites from those that are truly caused by the pathologic processes associated with DS. In the present study we performed a targeted metabolomic evaluation of serum samples from DS patients without dementia of two age classes (Younger DS Patients, YDSP, aging 20-40 years; Aged DS Patients, ADSP, aging 41-60 years), comparing the results with those that were obtained in two age classes of non-DS patients (Younger non-DS Patients, YnonDSP, aging 30-60 years; Aged-nonDS Patients, AnonDSP, aging 75-90 years). Of the 36 compounds assayed, 30 had significantly different concentrations in Pooled non-DS Patients (PnonDSP), compared to Pooled DS Patients (PDSP). Age categorization revealed that 11/30 compounds were significantly different in AnonDSP, compared to YnonDSP, indicating physiologic, age-related changes of their circulating concentrations. A comparison between YDSP and ADSP showed that 19/30 metabolites had significantly different values from those found in the corresponding classes of non-DS patients, strongly suggesting pathologic, DS-associated alterations of their serum levels. Twelve compounds selectively and specifically discriminated PnonDSP from PDSP, whilst only three discriminated YDSP from ADSP. The results allowed to determine, for the first time and to the best of our knowledge, the true, age-independent alterations of metabolism that are measurable in serum and attributable only to DS. These findings may be of high relevance for better strategies (pharmacological, nutritional) aiming to specifically target the dysmetabolism and decreased antioxidant defenses that are associated with DS.

Molecular Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping in Human Complex Diseases.	Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular traits from chromatin to metabolites (i.e., xQTLs) provides insight into the locations and effect modes of genetic variants that influence these molecular phenotypes and the propagation of functional consequences of each variant. xQTL studies indirectly interrogate the functional landscape of the molecular basis of complex diseases, including the impact of non-coding regulatory variants, the tissue specificity of regulatory elements, and their contribution to disease by integrating with genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We summarize a variety of molecular xQTL studies in human tissues and cells. In addition, using the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) as an example, we describe the ADSP xQTL project, a collaborative effort across the ADSP Functional Genomics Consortium (ADSP-FGC). The project's ultimate goal is a reference map of Alzheimer's-related QTLs using existing datasets from multiple omics layers to help us study the consequences of genetic variants identified in the ADSP. xQTL studies enable the identification of the causal genes and pathways in GWAS loci, which will likely aid in the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for complex diseases. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.	complex human diseases; molecular traits; xQTLs

Progranulin mutations in clinical and neuropathological Alzheimer's disease.	Progranulin (GRN) mutations occur in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), often with TDP-43 pathology. We determined the frequency of rs5848 and rare, pathogenic GRN mutations in two autopsy and one family cohort. We compared Braak stage, β-amyloid load, hyperphosphorylated tau (PHFtau) tangle density and TDP-43 pathology in GRN carriers and non-carriers. Pathogenic GRN mutations were more frequent in all cohorts compared to the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), but there was no evidence for association with AD. Pathogenic GRN carriers had significantly higher PHFtau tangle density adjusting for age, sex and APOE ε4 genotype. AD patients with rs5848 had higher frequencies of hippocampal sclerosis and TDP-43 deposits. Twenty-two rare, pathogenic GRN variants were observed in the family cohort. GRN mutations in clinical and neuropathological AD increase the burden of tau-related brain pathology but show no specific association with β-amyloid load or AD.

Single-Nucleus Atlas of Cell-Type Specific Genetic Regulation in the Human Brain.	Genetic risk variants for common diseases are predominantly located in non-coding regulatory regions and modulate gene expression. Although bulk tissue studies have elucidated shared mechanisms of regulatory and disease-associated genetics, the cellular specificity of these mechanisms remains largely unexplored. This study presents a comprehensive single-nucleus multi-ancestry atlas of genetic regulation of gene expression in the human prefrontal cortex, comprising 5.6 million nuclei from 1,384 donors of diverse ancestries. Through multi-resolution analyses spanning eight major cell classes and 27 subclasses, we identify genetic regulation for 14,258 genes, with 857 showing cell type-specific regulatory effects at the class level and 981 at the subclass level. Colocalization of genetic variants associated with gene regulation and disease traits uncovers novel cell type-specific genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and other disorders, which were not detectable in bulk tissue analyses. Analysis of dynamic genetic regulation at the single nucleus level identifies 2,073 genes with regulatory effects that vary across developmental trajectories, inferred from a broad age range of donors. We also uncover 1,655 genes with

The complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests in diverse clinical phenotypes, including cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs). However, the etiology of these phenotypes remains elusive. To address this, the PsychAD project generated a population-level single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset comprising over 6 million nuclei from the prefrontal cortex of 1,494 individual brains, covering a variety of AD-related phenotypes that capture cognitive impairment, severity of pathological lesions, and the presence of NPSs. Leveraging this dataset, we developed a deep learning framework, called Phenotype Associated Single Cell encoder (PASCode), to score single-cell phenotype associations, and identified ∼1.5 million phenotype associate cells (PACs). We compared PACs within 27 distinct brain cell subclasses and prioritized cell subpopulations and their expressed genes across various AD phenotypes, including the upregulation of a reactive astrocyte subtype with neuroprotective function in AD resilient donors. Additionally, we identified PACs that link multiple phenotypes, including a subpopulation of protoplasmic astrocytes that alter their gene expression and regulation in AD donors with depression. Uncovering the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying diverse AD phenotypes has the potential to provide valuable insights towards the identification of novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. All identified PACs, along with cell type and gene expression information, are summarized into an AD-phenotypic single-cell atlas for the research community.

Behavioral sensitization to repeated psychostimulant exposure is believed to contribute to the development of addiction. Nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA) is known to be a key substrate in sensitization, though recent work suggests that striatal acetylcholine (ACh) may also play a critical role. However, underlying ACh changes and their relationship to DA signaling have not been characterized. Here, we used dual-color fiber photometry to simultaneously measure DA and ACh in the NAcc shell of mice across repeated injections of cocaine or amphetamine. Repeated exposure progressively elevated locomotor activity and increased slow extracellular DA while attenuating transient DA release. Psychostimulants reduced phasic ACh transient amplitude and frequency, an effect that sensitized with repeated injections. However, the temporal coupling of DA and ACh remained unchanged. To determine whether D2 receptors (D2Rs) on cholinergic interneurons (CINs) drive this effect, we generated CIN-selective D2R knockout (KO) mice. Surprisingly, KOs continued to show an acute decrease in ACh and intact DA-ACh correlations after psychostimulant administration. However, they failed to exhibit sensitization of either DA or ACh in response to repeated psychostimulant administration. Despite this lack of sensitization in underlying neuromodulator signaling, the KO mice nevertheless exhibited behavioral sensitization, though at a slower rate than wild-type. These findings suggest that neural sensitization to psychostimulants is dependent on D2R expressed on CINs, but that behavioral sensitization is not dependent on sensitization of these underlying signals.

Nucleus accumbens volume mediates the association between prenatal adversity and attention problems in youth.	Exposure to adversity during the perinatal period has been associated with cognitive difficulties in children. Given the role of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in attention and impulsivity, we examined whether NAcc volume at age six mediates the relations between pre- and postnatal adversity and subsequent attention problems in offspring. 306 pregnant women were recruited as part of the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes Study. Psychosocial stress was assessed during pregnancy and across the first 5 years postpartum. At six years of age, children underwent structural MRI and, at age seven years, mothers reported on their children's attention problems. Separate factor analyses conducted on measures of pre- and postnatal adversity each yielded two latent factors: maternal mental health and socioeconomic status. Both pre- and postnatal maternal mental health predicted children's attention difficulties. Further, NAcc volume mediated the relation between prenatal, but not postnatal, maternal mental health and children's attention problems. These findings suggest that the NAcc is particularly vulnerable to prenatal maternal mental health challenges and contributes to offspring attention problems. Characterizing the temporal sensitivity of neurobiological structures to adversity will help to elucidate mechanisms linking environmental exposures and behavior, facilitating the development of neuroscience-informed interventions for childhood difficulties.	adversity; attention; maternal mental health; nucleus accumbens; perinatal

Multiple chronic conditions and polypharmacy in cognitively unimpaired older adults are associated with subsequent cognitive decline: results from the national alzheimer's coordinating center data.	Prior cross-sectional studies revealed that multiple chronic conditions (MCC) and polypharmacy are associated with cognitive impairment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the number of chronic conditions and the number of medications are associated with longitudinal changes in cognition (memory, attention/working memory, semantic ability/language, processing speed, executive function). We analyzed data from 5671 individuals (age 71.4 ± 9.3, 68 % female) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database who were cognitively unimpaired at baseline and had 3 or more subsequent visits. 57 % had more than two chronic conditions, and 44 % were taking 5 or more medications at baseline. At baseline, we observed that individuals with MCC had lower memory, attention/working memory, semantic ability/language, processing speed, and executive function performance than those without MCC. Using mixed-effect modeling approaches, we found that having a higher number of chronic conditions was associated with greater decline in semantic ability/language and executive function, and having a higher number of medications was associated with greater decline in attention/working memory, semantic ability/language, and executive function. The findings suggest that healthcare professionals and service providers should be conscious of the fact that patients dealing with MCC and those on multiple medications are vulnerable and require careful monitoring. Future studies are warranted using more comprehensive multimorbidity data and advanced analytic approaches, and prospective, controlled trials are warranted to test whether managing MCC and reducing the number of unnecessary medications or certain medications can prevent decline.

The effect of Alzheimer's disease genetic factors on limbic white matter microstructure.	White matter (WM) microstructure is essential for brain function but deteriorates with age and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diffusion MRI, enhanced by advanced bi-tensor models accounting for free water (FW), enables in vivo quantification of WM microstructural differences. To evaluate how AD genetic risk factors affect limbic WM microstructure - crucial for memory and early impacted in disease - we conducted linear regression analyses in a cohort of 2,614 non-Hispanic White aging adults (aged 50.12 to 100.85 years). The study evaluated 36 AD risk variants across 26 genes, the association between AD polygenic scores (PGSs) and WM metrics, and interactions with cognitive status. AD PGSs, variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and apolipoprotein E (APOE), and interactions involving MS4A6A were significantly linked to WM microstructure. These findings implicate AD-related genetic factors related to neurodevelopment (WNT3), lipid metabolism (APOE), and inflammation (TMEM106B, PTK2B, MS4A6A) that contribute to alternations in WM microstructure in older adults. AD risk variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and APOE genes showed distinct associations with limbic FW-corrected WM microstructure metrics. Interaction effects were observed between MS4A6A variants and cognitive status. PGS for AD was associated with higher FW content in the limbic system.

Aversion-induced dopamine reductions predict drug-taking and escape behaviors.	Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) has long been associated with the promotion of motivated behavior. However, inhibited dopamine signaling can increase behavior in certain settings, such as during drug self-administration. While aversive environmental stimuli can reduce dopamine, it is unclear whether such stimuli reliably engage this mechanism in different contexts. Here we compared the physiological and behavioral responses to the same aversive stimulus in different designs to determine if there is uniformity in the manner that aversive stimuli are encoded and promote behavior. NAcC dopamine was measured using fiber photometry in male and female rats during cocaine self-administration sessions in which an acutely aversive 90 dB white noise was intermittently presented. In a separate group of rats, aversion-induced changes in dopamine were measured during an escape design in which operant responses terminated aversive white noise. Aversive white noise significantly reduced NAcC dopamine and increased cocaine self-administration in both male and female rats. The same relationship was observed in the escape design, in which white noise reduced dopamine and promoted the performance of escape behavior. In both designs, the magnitude of the dopamine reduction predicted behavioral performance. While prior research demonstrated that pharmacologically reduced dopamine signaling can promote intake, this report demonstrates that this physiological mechanism is naturally engaged by aversive environmental stimuli and is generalizable to non-drug contexts. These findings illustrate a common physiological signature in response to aversion that may promote both adaptive and maladaptive behavior.

Clinical characteristics of pathological confirmed DLB without parkinsonism.	The misdiagnosis rate of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) remains high. Accurate diagnosis is paramount in the era of anti-amyloid therapy. The main objective of the current study is to elucidate early clinical features of pathologically confirmed DLB without parkinsonism (DLB-nP) that potentially resemble Alzheimer's disease (AD). We accessed the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database from 2005 to December 2022 data freeze and included 3159 Alzheimer's disease, 91 DLB-nP, and 307 DLB with parkinsonism (DLBP) cases. Diagnosis of AD and DLB were based on existing pathological criteria. First visit data was analyzed. Clinician-determined memory impairment is common in DLB-nP (87.9 % vs. AD 97.4 %) but is associated with a higher risk of AD diagnosis. Misdiagnosis as AD in DLB-nP stands at 75.8 %. Visual hallucinations (VH) or hallucinations are the only variables favoring DLB-nP diagnosis, but they only account for 22 % and 14 % of the cohort, respectively. After patients with VH were removed from the model, the misdiagnosis rate as AD increased to 85.2 %, and nighttime behavior was the only variable found to favor DLB-nP diagnosis. Visuospatial dysfunction is more common in DLB-P than DLB-nP but does not distinguish DLB-nP from AD. Amnestic presentation, while favoring AD diagnosis, is common in DLB without parkinsonism, and misdiagnosis is common. While VH remains the most prominent clinical feature for prompting DLB diagnosis, misdiagnosis becomes more profound in its absence during the early phase. In this study, exercising great caution during clinical assessment appears to be the fundamental way to minimize misdiagnosis for patients with amnestic presentation yet without parkinsonism and VH.

Patients with schizophrenia (SZ) exhibit an elevated risk of violence compared to the general population. However, the neural mechanisms of violence in SZ are still unclear. This study examined the neural correlates linked to violence in SZ and determine whether the brain abnormalities were associated with psychotic symptoms of severe delusions. We performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and assessed the severity of clinical symptoms and personality traits in 140 male participants, aged 18 to 50 years, comprising 39 violent patients with schizophrenia (VSZ), 45 non-violent patients with schizophrenia (NVSZ), and 56 healthy controls (HC). The results showed increased functional connectivity (FC) in the VSZ group in the right insula - middle frontal gyrus coupling(p < 0.001) and right fusiform gyrus (FFG) - left caudate (CAU) coupling (p < 0.001) as well as decreased FC in the right nucleus accumbens (NAcc) - FFG coupling (p = 0.002), compared to the NVSZ and HC groups. Correlation analysis revealed a negative association between affective deficit and FC of the right NAcc - FFG coupling in the VSZ group only (r = -0.350, p = 0.029). Additionally, suspiciousness correlated negatively with the FC value of the right CAU - left middle temporal gyrus coupling in the VSZ (r = -0.387, p = 0.029) and all-patient groups (r = -0.304, p = 0.023). Our findings suggested that aberrant connections between the cortex and subcortical nuclei, especially the striatal-temporal circuit, might be involved in the neurobiological mechanisms of violence in SZ; at the same time, dysfunction of the CAU might be linked to the disease per se. This study highlighting a specific association between violence and psychopathy rather than symptoms of SZ.	Nucleus accumbens; Positive symptoms; Schizophrenia; Striatal-temporal circuit; Violence

Exploring the power of MRI and clinical measures in predicting AD neuropathology.	Predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology prior to clinical diagnosis is important for identifying individuals at high risk of developing AD dementia. However, there remains a gap in leveraging MRI and clinical data to predict AD pathology. This study examines a novel machine learning approach that integrates the combined vascular (white matter hyperintensities, WMHs) and structural brain changes (gray matter, GM) with clinical factors (cognitive scores) to predict post-mortem neuropathology. Participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset (ADNI) and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) with both post-mortem neuropathology data and antemortem MRI and clinical data were included. Machine learning models were applied towards feature selection of the top seven MRI, clinical, and demographic data to identify the best performing set of variables that could predict postmortem neuropathology outcomes (i.e., neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, senile/amyloid plaques, and amyloid angiopathy). The best-performing neuropathology predictors from ADNI were then validated in NACC to compare results and ensure that the feature selection process did not lead to overfitting. In ADNI, the best-performing model included total and temporal lobe WMHs and achieved r = 0.87(RMSE = 0.62) during cross-validation for neuritic plaques. Overall, post-mortem neuropathology outcomes were predicted up to 14 years before death with high accuracies (~ 90%). Similar results were observed in the NACC dataset. These findings highlight that MRI features are critical to successfully predict AD-related pathology years in advance.

Quantification of perforant path fibers for early detection of Alzheimer's disease.	The entorhinal cortex (ERC) and perforant path (PP) fibers are critical structures in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to explore these regions using high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with the goal of identifying reliable biomarkers based on histopathological observations. Twenty post mortem brain specimens were scanned with 11.7T MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging and tractography, and were cut for subsequent histological examinations. The entorhinal cortical thickness and number of PP fibers derived from MRI were compared across neuropathological and premortem clinical diagnoses of AD. The entorhinal cortical thickness and number of PP fibers decreased along with severities of neurofibrillary tangles in the ERC. Meanwhile, a reduction in the number of PP fibers, but not the entorhinal cortical thickness, was observed during the preclinical stage of AD. Degeneration of PP fibers was observed in early AD and progressed along with neuropathological changes. Twenty post mortem brain tissues were scanned with 11.7T MRI. Degeneration of PP fibers was observed at 250 µm isotropic resolution. PP fiber indices were linked with severities of NFTs. The number of PP fibers was decreased in preclinical AD.

Pharmacological effects of bile acids on polycystic ovary syndrome via the regulation of chemerin.	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) poses significant health risks for women of reproductive age, and conventional treatments typically involve anti-hormonal interventions or surgical procedures, which often lead to lifelong medication cycles and potential side effects. Bile acids have been applied in the treatment of PCOS-related conditions, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of bile acids on a PCOS rat model and explore the underlying mechanisms involved. Morphological index evaluation, histopathological examination, and hormonal profiling were employed to assess the therapeutic effects of eight bile acids. A targeted proteomics was utilized to characterize and quantify highly homologous chemerin isoforms in rat serum. Network pharmacology analysis was conducted to identify potential targets and molecular mechanisms involved. Molecular docking was performed to evaluate the affinity between bile acids and farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Five of the eight bile acids markedly restored morphological indices, histopathological manifestations, hormonal imbalances, and chemerin isoform dysregulation. Notably, the therapeutic effects of TDCA and GUDCA on PCOS were reported for the first time. As the severity of the disease decreased, chemerin-157S was negatively correlated with progesterone (P4), estradiol (E2), antral follicles, and corpus luteum, respectively. Several chemerin-associated pathways have been identified via network pharmacology analysis. Additionally, a 7β-hydroxy group carried on the steroid skeleton of bile acids has been found to exhibit positive therapeutic efficacy in PCOS. Downregulating chemerin levels via specific bile acids may be a promising therapeutic strategy for PCOS patients.

Prevalence of Reported Dietary Supplement Use in 2019 Older Adult (≥ 55 Years) National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Participants With Normal Cognition, Mild Cognitive Impairment or Dementia.	In those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, nutritional intake decreases, increasing nutritional deficiency risk. Dietary supplements (DSs) may be an important source of nutrition, but recent insight into their use in those with normal cognition (NC), MCI or dementia is lacking. A cross-sectional study design determined prevalence for reported use of 12 DS categories and 19 individual DSs based on co-participant report in 9517 older adult (≥ 55 years) National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) participants diagnosed with NC (n = 5361), MCI (n = 1800) or dementia (n = 2347) in 2019. Multivariable binary logistic regression compared reported DS use prevalence between NC, MCI and dementia adjusting for demographics. Reported use of any DS was highly prevalent (NC: 76.6%, MCI: 73.9% and dementia: 69.6%). For all DS categories and many DSs, reported use was significantly lower in dementia compared to NC. Prevalence of reported use progressively declined from NC, MCI and dementia for 8/12 DS categories, including any vitamin (NC: 71.2%, MCI: 68% and dementia: 62.4%) and any mineral (NC: 34.8% MCI: 28.2% and dementia: 23.5%). This trend was also observed for 4/19 DSs, including vitamin D (NC: 49.2%, MCI: 41.2% and dementia: 36.7%). For vitamin B12 (NC: 15.5%, MCI: 18.2% and dementia: 18.5%) and melatonin (NC: 6.0%, MCI: 7.3% and dementia: 7.9%), prevalence increased from NC to MCI and from NC to dementia. For many DSs, prevalence was significantly lower in dementia compared to NC. Reported use of any DS was highly prevalent in NACC older adults with NC, MCI or dementia in 2019.	dementia; dietary supplements; mild cognitive impairment; minerals; supplements; vitamins

Cocaine use disorder (CUD) lacks FDA-approved treatments, partly due to the difficulty of creating therapeutics that target behavior-related neural circuits without disrupting signaling throughout the brain. Recent evidence highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting gut-brain axis components, such as GLP-1 receptors, to modulate neural circuits with minimal central nervous system disruption. Like GLP-1, pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (PACAP) is a component of the gut-brain axis that regulates behavior through a network spanning the gut and brain. Here, we investigated the potential existence and function of an endogenous PACAP signaling network within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc), which is a structure that integrates emotional, cognitive, and reward processes underlying behavior. We found that PACAP and its receptor, PAC1R, are endogenously expressed in the rat NAcc and that PACAP mRNA is present in medial prefrontal cortical projections to the NAcc. Behaviorally, intra-NAcc infusions of PACAP (100 pm) did not induce seeking behavior but blocked cocaine-primed reinstatement (10 mg/kg, IP). Intra-NAcc PACAP also inhibited reinstatement driven by co-infusion of the D1 receptor agonist (SKF 81297, 3 µg) but not the D2 receptor agonist (sumanirole, 10 ng). These findings are significant since D1 and D2 receptor activities in the NAcc govern distinct behavioral mechanisms indicating precise actions of PACAP even within the NAcc. Future research should examine whether NAcc PACAP signaling can be selectively engaged by peripheral gut-brain axis mechanisms, potentially unveiling novel therapeutic approaches for CUD and related disorders.

Unraveling temporal patterns of diagnostic markers and comorbidities in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from large-scale data.	Comorbid conditions associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood regarding timing and potential impact on disease onset and progression. Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV electronic health records from 2008 to 2019 were examined. The study identified 2527 AD patients (34.9% male, mean age 80.27 years) among 299,712 patients. We examined the timing of 12 cardiovascular and metabolic diseases relative to AD diagnosis. Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center validated the findings. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, diagnosed 1.09 years before AD. Depression was the only comorbidity diagnosed after AD start, 0.16 years on average. AD patients had greater rates of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and depression compared to the general population. The findings emphasize early detection and therapy of AD-related comorbidities, notably cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The temporal link between these diseases and AD suggests opportunities for preventive strategies and improved care pathways. Temporal analysis of comorbidities: The study reveals hypertension and hyperlipidemia as leading precursors to AD, typically diagnosed 1 to 1.3 years prior to AD onset, while depression emerges predominantly after diagnosis. Unique data integration: Large-scale datasets from MIMIC-IV (n = 299,712) and NACC (n = 51,836) were leveraged to identify chronological patterns in 12 key comorbid conditions relative to AD diagnosis. Sex- and age-specific insights: AD prevalence peaks at 80 to 86 years, with females exhibiting higher rates of LOAD compared to males. Depression as a post-diagnostic marker: Unlike other comorbidities, depression's post-diagnostic mean onset (0.16 years after AD diagnosis) highlights the need for targeted mental health interventions in AD patients. Implications for early detection: Findings suggest that managing hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other modifiable conditions in midlife may delay or reduce the risk of AD development. Comorbidity variability across cohorts: Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia showed significantly higher prevalence in the NACC cohort compared to MIMIC-IV, reflecting potential dataset-specific biases or regional healthcare differences. Future research directions: Advocates for longitudinal, multiethnic, and global studies to refine early diagnostic criteria and explore preventive strategies tailored to comorbid conditions.

Combination therapy targeting Alzheimer's disease risk factors is associated with a significant delay in Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive decline can be a major contributor to loss of independent living. Therapeutic strategies that alter the course of cognitive deterioration have the potential to sustain activities of daily living, promote quality of life, and delay transition to nursing-home care. We performed longitudinal linear regression analysis of National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) cognitive data from 7653 mild dementia AD participants at baseline with at least one medication for diabetes (DBMD), lipid-lowering (LIPL), anti-hypertensive (AHTN), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSD) medications or any combination in 5684 (74%) participants and in 1969 (26%) participants with no study-relevant prescriptions over 10 years. Change in cognitive function was determined by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Combination of DBMD+LIPL+AHTN+NSD (QuadRx) resulted in a significant 46% MMSE and 32% CDR-SB delay in cognitive decline at 5 years, which was sustained at 10 years with a delay in decline of 47% MMSE and 33% CDR-SB. QuadRx was equally effective for the delay of cognitive decline in both females and males at 5 and 10 years. QuadRx mitigated the impact of the Combination therapy was associated with a significant delay in cognitive decline in NACC AD participants at a magnitude comparable to or greater than amyloid beta immunomodulators. Further, the delay in decline was sustained for 10 years. The impact of QuadRx to delay cognitive decline was validated in deeply characterized ADNI participants. These data support combination therapy in persons with AD risk factors to alter the course of AD that persists for a decade, enabling cognitive function at a magnitude associated with independent living. QuadRx slowed Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive decline by 47% in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center NACC and 60% in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI participants.Combination therapy exhibited additive and synergistic slowing of cognitive decline.QuadRx was equally effective in females and males at 5 and 10 years.QuadRx mitigated the impact of the apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype.QuadRx was effective in AD participants reporting drug use for their AD risk factor.

Amyloid PET predicts longitudinal functional and cognitive trajectories in a heterogeneous cohort.	Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly available for diagnosis of Alzheimer`s disease (AD); however, its practical implications in heterogenous cohorts are debated. Amyloid PET from 890 National Alzheimer`s Coordinating Center participants with up to 10 years post-PET follow up was analyzed. Cox proportional hazards and linear mixed models were used to investigate amyloid burden prediction of etiology and prospective functional status and cognitive decline. Amyloid positivity was associated with progression from unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Amyloid burden in the unimpaired group was associated with lower initial memory levels and faster decline in memory, language, and global cognition. In the Impaired group, amyloid was associated with lower initial levels and faster decline for memory, language, executive function, and global cognition. Amyloid burden is an important prognostic marker in a clinically heterogeneous cohort. Future work is needed to establish the proportion of decline driven by AD versus non-AD processes in the context of mixed pathology. Our findings highlight the importance of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) in heterogenous cohorts, including diverse demographics, clinical syndromes, and underlying etiologies. The results also provide evidence that higher amyloid levels were linked to functional progression from unimpaired cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to dementia. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, higher amyloid burden was associated with poorer memory at baseline and subsequent declines in memory, language, and global cognition. Among individuals with cognitive impairment, amyloid burden was associated with worse initial memory, language, executive function, and global cognition, and faster declines over time.

Racial and ethnic differences in white matter hypointensities: The role of vascular risk factors.	White matter hypointensities (WMHs) are markers of cerebrovascular pathology associated with cognitive decline. Reports of racial and ethnic differences in WMHs have been inconsistent across studies. This study examined whether race and ethnicity influence WMH burden and whether vascular risk factors explain these differences. Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center included 7132 Whites, 892 Blacks, 283 Asians, and 661 Hispanics. Baseline and longitudinal WMHs were examined using linear regression and mixed-effects models across racial and ethnic groups, controlling for demographics and vascular risk factors. Adjusting for vascular risk factors reduced WMH burden differences and eliminated differences in temporal regions in Black versus White older adults. For Hispanics, differences became significant after adjusting for vascular risk factors. Although some racial and ethnic WMH disparities are influenced by vascular risk factors, others persist, highlighting the need for multidimensional approaches when targeting WMHs in diverse populations. Current research is inconsistent as to whether there are racial differences in white matter hypointensities (WMHs). Blacks exhibit higher WMH burden than Whites, mediated by vascular factors. In Hispanics, WMH differences emerged only after adjusting for vascular risk factors.	cognitive aging; dementia; ethnicity; race; vascular risk factors; white matter hypointensity

Motor symptoms in autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease increase the risk of progression to severe cognitive impairment.	Motor symptoms may present throughout the Alzheimer's disease (AD) course. We evaluated the impact of motor symptoms on the risk of progression to severe cognitive impairment, severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), and mortality in patients with autopsy-confirmed AD. We also examined the rates of non-AD pathology and identified the predictors of disease progression among these patients. Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) were used for this analysis. Participants (N = 1167) were required to have autopsy-confirmed AD. Motor symptoms were predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment but not progression to severe NPSs or death. Presenting with gait disturbance and slowness but not falls or tremor was predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment. Patients with motor symptoms had higher rates of Lewy body disease pathology on autopsy. Our findings suggest that the presence of motor symptoms in autopsy-confirmed AD, particularly gait disturbance and slowness, are predictive of more rapid cognitive decline. Clinician-defined motor symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) predicted more rapid progression to severe cognitive impairment but not to severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) or death. Among AD patients with motor symptoms, presenting with gait disturbance and slowness was predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment, whereas presenting with falls and tremor was not predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment. Patients with motor symptoms, particularly gait disturbance and slowness, had higher rates of comorbid Lewy body disease pathology.

Slow-wave sleep (SWS) is essential for restorative neural processes and its decline is associated with both healthy and pathological ageing. Building on previous rodent research, this longitudinal study identified a significant association between nucleus accumbens (NAcc) volume and SWS duration in cognitively unimpaired older adults, whilst no significant link was observed between NAcc volume and N2 or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentage. Our findings support the involvement of the NAcc in ageing-related modulation of SWS and thus suggest the NAcc as a potential neural marker or therapeutic target for improving SWS.

Stress is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders and affects neuroplasticity in brain areas like the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) and the insular cortex (IC). This study examined neuroplasticity changes in the aIC-NAcC circuit after restraint stress in male and female rats, and explored the role of the endocannabinoid system. Male and female rats underwent 2 h of acute restraint stress. Behavioral tests and in vivo electrophysiological recordings were performed immediately and 24 h after stress exposure. cFos was performed immediately after stress. Since stress effects were observed only in males, we evaluated the systemic and intra-NAc blockade of CB1 receptors in male rats. We found increased c-Fos expression in the hypothalamus but not in the IC in both sexes after acute restraint stress, along with heightened anxiety and reduced exploratory behavior. Males and females exhibited different neuronal plasticity in the aIC-NAcC pathway. Under basal conditions, males showed equal proportions of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), whereas females predominantly exhibited LTP. Stress disrupted synaptic plasticity in males by eliminating LTD in the aIC-NAcC pathway 24 h after exposure. This effect was reversed by systemic and local CB1 receptor blockade. These findings suggest that integration of aIC information into NAcC differs by sex, with stress-induced neuroplasticity changes occurring only in males, dependent on the endocannabinoid system. This study provides insight into sex differences in stress reactivity, which may relate to stress-related psychiatric disorders.

Persistent nociceptive inputs arising from peripheral tissues or/and nerve injuries cause maladaptive changes in neurons or neural circuits in the central nervous system, which further confer acute injury into chronic pain transitions (pain chronification) even after the injury is resolved. However, the critical brain regions and their neural mechanisms involved in this transition have not yet been elucidated. Here, we reveal an accumbal microcircuit that is essential for pain chronification. Notably, the increase of neuronal activity in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS) in the acute phase (<7 days) and in core (NAcC) in the chronic phase (14-21 days) was detected in a neuropathic pain mouse model. Importantly, we demonstrated that the NAcS neuronal activation in the acute phase of injury was necessary and sufficient for the development of chronic neuropathic pain. This process was mediated by the accumbal dopamine D2 receptor-expressing neuronal microcircuit from NAcS to NAcC. Thus, our findings reveal an accumbal microcircuit mechanism for pain chronification and suggest that the early intervention targeting this microcircuit may provide a therapeutic approach to pain chronification.

Novel modelling approaches to elucidate the genetic architecture of resilience to Alzheimer's disease.	"Up to 30% of older adults meet pathological criteria for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at autopsy yet never show signs of cognitive impairment. Recent work has highlighted genetic drivers of this resilience, or better-than-expected cognitive performance given a level of neuropathology, that allow the aged brain to protect itself from the downstream consequences of amyloid and tau deposition. However, models of resilience have been constrained by reliance on measures of neuropathology, substantially limiting the number of participants available for analysis. We sought to determine if novel approaches using APOE allele status, age, and other demographic variables as a proxy for neuropathology could still effectively quantify resilience and uncover novel genetic drivers associated with better-than-expected cognitive performance while vastly expanding sample size and statistical power. Leveraging 20,513 participants from eight well-characterized cohort studies of aging, we determined the effects of genetic variants on resilience metrics using mixed-effects regressions. The outcome of interest was residual cognitive resilience, quantified from residuals in three cognitive domains (memory, executive function, and language) and built within two frameworks: ""silver"" models, which obviate the requirement for neuropathological data (n=17,241), and ""gold"" models, which include post-mortem neuropathological assessments (n=3,272). We then performed cross-ancestry genome wide association studies (European ancestry n=18,269, African ancestry n=2,244), gene and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses. All analyses were conducted across all participants and repeated when restricted to those with unimpaired cognition at baseline. Despite different modeling approaches, the silver and gold phenotypes were highly correlated (R=0.77-0.88) and displayed comparable performance in quantifying better-than or worse-than-expected cognition, enabling silver-gold meta-analyses. Genetic correlation analyses highlighted associations of resilience with multiple neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular traits (PFDR values < 5.0x10-2). In pathway-level tests, we observed three significant associations with resilience: metabolism of amino acids and derivatives (PFDR=4.1x10-2), negative regulation of transforming growth factor beta production (PFDR=1.9x10-2), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (PFDR=3.9x10-4). Finally, in single-variant analyses, we identified a locus on chromosome 17 approaching genome-wide significance among cognitively unimpaired participants (index single nucleotide polymorphism: rs757022, minor allele frequency = 0.18, β=0.08, P=1.1x10-7). The top variant at this locus (rs757022) was significantly associated with expression of numerous ATP-binding cassette genes in brain. Overall, through validating a novel modeling approach, we demonstrate the utility of silver models of resilience to increase statistical power and participant diversity."

Marital status and risk of dementia over 18 years: Surprising findings from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center.	Marital status is a potential risk/protective factor for adverse health outcomes. This study tested whether marital status was associated with dementia risk in older adults. Participants (N = 24,107; Mean Compared to married participants, widowed (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.67-0.79), divorced (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.59-0.73), and never-married participants (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.52-0.71) were at lower dementia risk, including for Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. The associations for divorced and never married remained significant accounting for demographic, behavioral, clinical, genetic, referral source, participation, and diagnostic factors. The associations were slightly stronger among professional referrals, males, and relatively younger participants. Unmarried individuals may have a lower risk of dementia compared to married adults. The findings could indicate delayed diagnoses among unmarried individuals or challenge the assumption that marriage protects against dementia. Widowed, divorced, and never-married older adults had a lower dementia risk, compared to their married counterparts. Unmarried older adults were also at a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia, with a pattern of mixed findings for frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and no associations with risk of vascular dementia or mild cognitive impairment. All unmarried groups were at a lower risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. There was some evidence of moderation by age, sex, and referral source. However, stratified analyses showed small differences between groups, and most interactions were not significant, suggesting that the role of marital status in dementia tends to be similar across individuals at different levels of dementia risk due to education, depression, and genetic vulnerability.

The impact of arteriolosclerosis on cognitive impairment in decedents without severe dementia from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center.	Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), Lewy body disease (LBD), and vascular neuropathologies occur together. Previous studies have been limited by a large majority of participants with severe dementia or advanced stages of pathologies, which limits the detectability of cognitive effects from vascular neuropathologies. Using neuropathology data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, we examined the association of vascular neuropathologies with cognitive scores in participants without severe dementia (N = 1526) using multivariable linear regression. Controlling for age, sex, education, LBD, and ADNC, arteriolosclerosis was associated with lower memory (β = -0.16 ± 0.06, p < 0.001), executive function (β = -0.25 ± 0.05, p < 0.001), and language scores (β = -0.20 ± 0.05, p < 0.001). The effects of arteriolosclerosis remained when controlling for vascular risk factors. Vascular neuropathologies exhibit distinct relationships with cognition. Arteriolosclerosis is an independent contributor to cognition. Further research should be conducted on whether arteriolosclerosis can serve as a surrogate marker for cognitive decline in early disease stages. In individuals who do not have severe dementia, vascular neuropathologies are common, and the combination of pathologies is heterogeneous in a convenience sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center that reported all the neuropathology data elements for this investigation. Arteriolosclerosis is associated with several cognitive domain scores, including memory, executive function, and language when controlling for the effects of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change and Lewy body disease. These results reinforce the importance of vascular pathology for cognition among people along the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.

Distinct medical and substance use histories associate with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.	Phenotype clustering reduces patient heterogeneity and could be useful when designing precision clinical trials. We hypothesized that the onset of early cognitive decline in patients would exhibit variance predicated on the clinical history documented prior to an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Self-reported medical and substance use history (i.e., problem history) was used to cluster participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) into distinct subtypes. Linear mixed effects modeling was used to determine the effect of problem history subtype on cognitive decline over 2 years. Two thousand seven hundred fifty-four individuals were partitioned into three subtypes: minimal (n = 1380), substance use (n = 1038), and cardiovascular (n = 336). The cardiovascular problem history subtype had significantly worse cognitive decline over a 2 year follow-up period (p = 0.013). Our study highlights the need to account for problem history to reduce heterogeneity of outcomes in AD clinical trials. Clinical data were used to identify subtypes of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset. Three problem history subtypes were found: minimal, substance use, and cardiovascular. The mean change in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) was assessed over a 2 year follow-up. The cardiovascular subtype was associated with the worst cognitive decline. The magnitude of change in CDR-SB was similar to recent AD clinical trials.

Crystallin Alpha B Inhibits Cocaine-Induced Conditioned Place Preference via the Modulation of Dopaminergic Neurotransmission.	Nonneuronal cells mediate neurotransmission and drug addiction. However, the role of oligodendrocytes in stress-induced cocaine relapses remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of the oligodendrocyte-abundant molecule crystallin alpha B (CRYAB) in cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) relapsed by restraint stress. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to identify oligodendrocytes and stress-associated molecules in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of both drug users and cocaine-treated animals. Further, we studied which cell subtypes in the brain express CRYAB. The effects of stress hormones and cocaine on CRYAB expression were evaluated in vitro in human oligodendrocytes. CRYAB is upregulated in the NAcc of both cocaine-treated animals and drug users. CRYAB levels in the NAcc of mice increased during CPP development but decreased following stress-induced relapse. Interestingly, CRYAB is expressed in oligodendrocytes in the NAcc of mice. Extracellular CRYAB levels are regulated by cocaine and stress hormone treatments in oligodendrocyte cultures. Dopamine levels in the NAcc and CPP development of CPP are significantly increased by cocaine in CRYAB knockout (KO) mice. Further, we demonstrated that CRYAB binds to the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) in the NAcc of mice treated with cocaine. We suggest that oligodendrocyte-derived CRYAB regulates dopamine neurotransmission and stress-evoked cocaine reward behaviour via the modulation of EAAT2 in the NAcc.	cocaine relapse; crystallin alpha B; drug addiction; excitatory amino acid transporter 2; nucleus accumbens; oligodendrocytes

Nucleus Accumbens Resting State Functional Connectivity is Linked to Family Income, Reward Salience, and Substance Use.	As a central component of the brain's reward system, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) plays a crucial role in reward salience and substance use behaviors. Changes in the NAcc are also relevant to higher rates of substance use of youth and adults from low-income backgrounds. Although resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the NAcc provides valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying reward processing and the propensity for self-reported reward salience and substance use, research exploring the association between NAcc rsFC and brain networks beyond the default mode network (DMN) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) is limited. To investigate the role of the resting-state functional connectivity of the NAcc with the cingulo-opercular network, sensorimotor mouth network, and sensorimotor hand network in the association between socioeconomic status, self-reported reward salience, and future substance use. Data were obtained from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. NAcc rsFC with the cingulo-opercular network, sensorimotor mouth network, and sensorimotor hand network was assessed at baseline. Socioeconomic status was measured using family income. Self-reported reward salience was assessed using validated psychometric scales. Substance use outcomes were tracked longitudinally over the study period. Structural Equation Modeling was employed to examine the covariances between family income, NAcc rsFC, reward salience, and subsequent substance use. Higher baseline family income was positively associated with baseline NAcc rsFC (B = 0.092, p < 0.001) and negatively associated with baseline reward salience (B = -0.040, p = 0.036) and future substance use (B = -0.081, p < 0.001). Baseline NAcc rsFC was strongly and positively associated with reward salience (B = 0.734, p < 0.001) and future substance use up to age 13 (B = 0.124, p < 0.001). Additionally, baseline reward salience was positively associated with future substance use (Covariance = 0.176, p < 0.001). The findings suggest that NAcc rsFC with brain networks beyond the DMN or PFC may contribute to the links between low parental socioeconomic status, reward salience, and substance use risk. Expanding the understanding of NAcc rsFC provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying these associations. These results have important implications for developing targeted interventions aimed at preventing substance use, particularly among low-income youth with heightened reward salience. Further research is needed to explore causal pathways and moderating factors influencing these relationships.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms cluster and fluctuate over time in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.	Cognitive and behavioral phenomena define behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), but neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) outside the core criteria are common throughout the illness. Identifying how NPS cluster in bvFTD may guide development of future therapies. Participants (n = 354) with sporadic and genetic bvFTD were enrolled in the ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Consortium. Dementia stage was defined as early (CDR® plus NACC FTLD ≤1) or advanced (CDR® plus NACC FTLD ≥1). Baseline and annual follow-up visit data were analyzed to compare NPS across stages of bvFTD. Psychiatric states were captured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire and Clinician Judgment of Symptoms. Polychoric cluster analysis was used to describe NPS clusters. NPS were highly prevalent (≥90%) in early and late bvFTD. Four NPS clusters were identified based on magnitude of factor loadings: affective, disinhibited, compulsive, and psychosis. Neuropsychiatric symptoms fluctuated across visits. In the affective cluster, depression showed the least visit-to-visit stability. In the disinhibited cluster, elation showed the least stability. Symptoms in the psychosis and compulsive clusters (hallucinations, delusions, obsessions/compulsions, and hyperorality) were largely stable, persisting from visit-to-visit in more than 50% of cases. Symptoms in the affective and disinhibited cluster were associated with the highest caregiver burden, while symptoms in the obsessive cluster were associated with the most functional impairment. NPS in bvFTD are frequent and cluster into four discrete groups. The fluctuating nature of some NPS in bvFTD suggests that they may not be reliable markers of disease progression or stage.

Decoding latent preferences for novel products is crucial for understanding decision-making processes, especially when subjective evaluations are unclear. Brain activity in regions like the medial orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) correlates with subjective preferences. However, whether these regions represent preferences toward novel products and whether coding persists after familiarity remain unclear. We examined the brain coding of latent preferences for novel scented products and how they evolve with familiarity. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals evoked by three fabric softener odors, both when novel and when familiar, in 25 previously unexposed females. To obtain reliable preferences, participants chose one softener after using all three twice at home after the first fMRI measurement (Day 1) and continued using it at home for four months until the second day of the fMRI measurement (Day 2). Subjective ratings were also obtained after each fMRI run. On Day 1, no significant differences in subjective ratings between selected and non-selected odors were found. However, the decoding analysis revealed that future odor preferences for novel products were coded in several regions, including the left superior frontal lobe (SF), right NAcc, and left piriform cortex. On Day 2, the left SF continued to encode preferences after familiarity. These results suggest that odor preferences for novel products are coded in the brain even without conscious awareness, and that the coding in the SF is robust against familiarity. These findings provide insights into a more comprehensive understanding of the brain coding of latent preferences.	Decoding; Human; Olfactory; Preference; fMRI

Development and Preliminary Validation of Standardized Regression-Based Change Scores as Measures of Transitional Cognitive Decline.	An increasing focus in Alzheimer's disease and aging research is to identify transitional cognitive decline. One means of indexing change over time in serial cognitive evaluations is to calculate standardized regression-based (SRB) change indices. This paper includes development and preliminary validation of SRB indices for the Uniform Data Set 3.0 Neuropsychological Battery, as well as base rate data to aid in their interpretation. The sample included 1341 cognitively intact older adults with serial assessments over 0.5-2 years in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Database. SRB change scores were calculated in half of the sample, then validated in the other half of the sample. Base rates of SRB decline were evaluated at z-score cut-points, corresponding to two-tailed p-values of .20 (z = -1.282), 0.10 (z = -1.645) and .05 (z = -1.96). We examined convergent associations of SRB indices for each cognitive measure with each other, as well as concurrent associations of SRB indices with Clinical Dementia Rating sum of box scores (CDR-SB). SRB equations were able to significantly predict the selected cognitive variables. The base rate of at least one significant SRB decline across the entire battery ranged from 28.91% to 64.90%. SRB indices for cognitive measures demonstrated theoretically expected significant positive associations with each other. Additionally, CDR-SB impairment was associated with decline on three different SRB indices. This paper provides preliminary validation of SRB indices in a large sample, and we present a user-friendly tool for calculating SRB values.

Phase 2 study of palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline in frontotemporal dementia patients.	Frontotemporal dementia is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which no pharmacological treatments have been approved. Neuroinflammation plays a central role in driving the pathogenic mechanisms underlying frontotemporal dementia. In the last few years, co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline has emerged as a potential therapeutic molecule in neurodegenerative disorders pathogenically related to frontotemporal dementia, for its demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Here we wanted to determine whether treatment with co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline may have a clinical impact in frontotemporal dementia patients. We performed a Phase 2, monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline in frontotemporal dementia patients. Forty eight patients with a diagnosis of probable frontotemporal dementia were randomly assign in a 1:1 ratio to receive co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline oral suspension at the dosage of 700 mg + 70 mg twice/day (	cognitive decline; frontotemporal dementia; neuroinflammation; palmitoylethanolamide; synaptic activity

Neuropsychological and clinical indicators of Lewy body and Alzheimer's pathology.	Clinical distinction between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) poses significant challenges due to pathological comorbidity. Similar ages of onset and overlapping cognitive and psychiatric symptoms can lead to diagnostic inaccuracy and inappropriate treatment recommendations. Identify the best combination of clinical and neuropsychological predictors of AD, DLB, and mixed DLB/AD neuropathology in dementia patients. Using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset, we selected either pure AD ( Gait disturbances (odds ratio (OR) = 19.32; p = 0.01), visual-spatial complaints (OR = 6.06; p = 0.03), and visual hallucinations (OR = 31.06; p = 0.002) predicted DLB compared to AD, along with better memory (OR = 3.42; p = 0.003), naming (OR = 3.35; p = 0.002), and worse processing speed (OR = 0.51; p = 0.01). When comparing DLB to DLB/AD, gait disturbances (OR = 6.33; p = 0.01), increased depressive symptoms (OR = 1.44; p = 0.03), and better memory (OR = 3.01; p = 0.004) predicted DLB. Finally, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (OR = 6.44; p = 0.004), parkinsonism severity (OR = 1.07; p = 0.02), and lower depressive symptoms (OR = 0.70; p = 0.006) and memory impairment (OR = 0.57; p = 0.02) distinguished DLB/AD from AD. Our study converges with prior research suggesting specific neuropsychological and clinical features can help distinguish DLB from AD. Neuropsychological differentiation becomes more challenging among mixed pathologies and in advanced cognitive impairment, although the presence of RBD and parkinsonism distinguished DLB. Earlier clinical assessment and incorporation of in vivo and postmortem biomarkers should enhance diagnostic accuracy and understanding of disease characteristics, offering significant relevance for disease-modifying treatments.

Effect Modifiers of the Association of Blood Pressure With Brain Amyloid and Tau Pathology.	Hypertension is an important modifiable risk factor of Alzheimer disease (AD), but previous studies reported heterogeneous associations of late-life blood pressure (BP) with brain amyloid and tau pathologies. We investigated how the associations of BP with brain amyloid and tau vary by We performed analyses among participants with postmortem neuropathology measurements (2005-June 2022) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. The average systolic BP (SBP) of the first 3 annual visits was the primary exposure, and baseline hypertension status was the secondary exposure. Brain AD pathologies were assessed using Thal and Braak staging. Potential modifiers included Among 2,094 participants (baseline age: 75 ± 9.5 years; 51.4% women), the association of higher SBP with higher amyloid and tau burdens varied by stroke history and cognitive status while the effect modification by age or Preexisting cerebrovascular burden and cognitive status might interact with elevated SBP in their association with higher brain amyloid and tau, which could help identify high-risk subgroups for BP management and AD prevention. These heterogeneous association patterns need to be confirmed in longitudinal studies with in vivo AD pathology assessments.

We included all 3,343 participants of the NACC dataset with available post-mortem pathology reports. 887 participants were potential candidates for anti-Aβ immunotherapy as they presented with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and the clinical diagnosis of AD (amnestic AD syndrome). Applying the criterion of amyloid positivity (post mortem report) and the clinical trial inclusion and exclusion criteria to this sample resulted in 83 (9 %), 275 (31 %), and 172 (19 %) participants eligible for treatment with aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, respectively. Applying the criteria of the AUR resulted in 242 (27 %) and 266 (30 %) participants eligible for treatment with aducanumab or lecanemab, respectively. The eligible participant groups for each antibody showed partial, but not full overlap. Co-pathologies were common. The number of eligible participants varies between the different antibodies and the selected groups only partly overlap, indicating partly different groups of eligible participants for each antibody. Since not all inclusion and exclusion criteria can be extracted from the NACC-UDS dataset, the real number of eligible patients will be smaller.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective treatment for patients with major depression, bipolar depression, mania, catatonia, and severe psychosis. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of ECT largely remain unknown. While previous preclinical studies have noted a role for neurotropic signaling, neurogenesis, and alterations in monoamine neurotransmitter systems, these models were largely conducted using procedures that deviate from clinical practice. Therefore, we sought to develop a clinically relevant murine model of electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), a model of ECT, which more closely replicates current clinical approaches and then employ this model to explore ECS mechanisms. Using the well-established chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm, known to disrupt reward and motivated behaviors, we investigated whether the behavioral changes after CSDS could be reversed following a clinically related course of ECS. Additionally, we observed induction of plasticity-related genes in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala, regions responsible for reward- and fear-related memory, respectively. Lastly, we investigated ECS-related changes in the NAcc with RNA-sequencing. This approach revealed a gene expression profile associated with ECS-related changes in NAcc. Pathway analysis demonstrated cellular changes primarily involved in regulating cell migration and differentiation. Therefore, utilizing our novel and clinically relevant model of ECS, we have begun to elucidate mechanisms that contribute to ECTs therapeutic outcomes by examining murine behavior and RNA from brain regions associated with stress-induced states that model anxiety and depression and the impact of ECS.

Montreal Cognitive Assessment vs the Mini-Mental State Examination as a Screening Tool for Patients With Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia.	With upcoming clinical trials targeting preclinical stages of genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD), early detection through cognitive screening is crucial. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) have potential as screening instruments for early-stage genetic FTD. However, no comparative evaluation has been performed. We aimed to compare MMSE and MoCA performance among presymptomatic, prodromal, and symptomatic pathogenic variant carriers to analyze which screening test has superior discriminative abilities. We used cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 2 longitudinal genetic FTD cohort studies in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, collected between 2021 and 2024. Participants were either presymptomatic, prodromal, or symptomatic pathogenic variant carriers or healthy controls (first-degree family members without pathogenic variants for FTD). Grouping was based on the global CDR-plus-NACC-FTLD score. Participants were assessed with both MoCA and MMSE. Statistical analyses compared total and subscores between groups and evaluated predictive and classification accuracy of both tests. A total of 243 participants (mean age 49.9 ± 13.1 years, mean education 14.5 ± 3.0 years, 56% female), 157 of whom were pathogenic variant carriers ( Its higher sensitivity and better discriminative power make MoCA a more valuable tool for cognitive screening in upcoming clinical trials targeting preclinical FTD. Future studies should aim for larger sample sizes from additional study centers.

Gaps, challenges and opportunities towards achieving the 95-95-95 targets in Cameroon: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.	"Given HIV elimination by 2030, the World Health Organization and the United Nations' Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have set three programmatic goals that all countries should have achieved before 2025; 95% of people living with HIV should know their status (target-1); 95% of people who know their status should be linked to treatment (target-2); and 95% of people on treatment should achieve viral load suppression (i.e. VL<1000 copies/ml; target-3). Despite considerable global progress over the past decade, many low-middle-income countries are still below the expected targets. This review protocol aims to provide a standardized document for in-depth analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) towards achieving these programmatic targets in Cameroon. This systematic review will include randomized and non-randomized trials, cohorts, case-controls, cross-sectional studies, case reports and governmental notices addressing the achievements, the gaps, the challenges and the opportunities towards the 95-95-95 targets in Cameroon. The search will consider studies from 2017 to 2024, retrieved from PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, online African journals, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. We will include studies reporting HIV diagnosis, HIV link to treatment or HIV viral suppression in Cameroon. Results will be stratified according to time, age-group (adults' vs adolescents/children) and geographic locations. Primary outcomes will be ""estimates on 95-95-95 programmatic goals at the national level"". Secondary outcomes will consist of the SWOT analysis towards achieving these programmatic targets. A random-effects model will be used to calculate pooled prevalence if data permits. This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol will guide global estimation on the achievement of the 95-95-95 targets as well as the stakes and challenges within the Cameroonian setting. Final evidence from the systematic review will allow identification of the gaps and measures to be taken to fasten our move towards the 95-95-95 in Cameroon by 2025.

Advancing Alzheimer's disease risk prediction: development and validation of a machine learning-based preclinical screening model in a cross-sectional study.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant challenge for individuals aged 65 and older, being the most prevalent form of dementia. Although existing AD risk prediction tools demonstrate high accuracy, their complexity and limited accessibility restrict practical application. This study aimed to develop a convenience, efficient prediction model for AD risk using machine learning techniques. We conducted a cross-sectional study with participants aged 60 and older from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. We selected personal characteristics, clinical data and psychosocial factors as baseline predictors for AD (March 2015 to December 2021). The study utilised Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms alongside traditional logistic regression for modelling. An oversampling method was applied to balance the data set. This study has no interventions. The study included 2379 participants, of whom 507 were diagnosed with AD. Including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. RESULTS: 11 variables were critical in the training phase, including educational level, depression, insomnia, age, Body Mass Index (BMI), medication count, gender, stenting, systolic blood pressure (sbp), neurosis and rapid eye movement. The XGBoost model exhibited superior performance compared with other models, achieving area under the curve of 0.915, sensitivity of 76.2% and specificity of 92.9%. The most influential predictors were educational level, total medication count, age, sbp and BMI. The proposed classifier can help guide preclinical screening of AD in the elderly population.

Anhedonia, a core feature of major depressive disorder (MDD), presents significant treatment challenges with conventional methods. Circuit-targeted, personalized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown potentiation by focusing on disruptions in specific networks related to anhedonia. However, how rTMS modulates brain network dynamics in anhedonia is not yet fully understood. This research sought to explore these effects using EEG microstate analysis. In this double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study, resting-state functional MRI was employed to pinpoint the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) region that exhibited the strongest functional connectivity to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), used as the target for rTMS stimulation. Rest-state EEG data from 49 depressive patients with anhedonia(active=26, sham=23) were analyzed both at baseline and after treatment. In addition, a group of 15 healthy participants was included to serve as baseline controls. Resting-state EEG data were collected at baseline and post-treatment. Using polarity-insensitive k-means clustering, EEG microstates were segmented into five categories (A-E). Circuit-targeted rTMS significantly alleviated symptoms of anhedonia and depression. Compared to healthy controls, patients with anhedonia showed reduced microstate B and C occurrence, along with increased microstate D duration. After rTMS targeting the DLPFC-NAcc pathway, the active treatment group exhibited normalization of microstate C occurrence and a reduction in microstate E duration. Notably, the increase in microstate C was significantly correlated with improvements in anticipatory anhedonia, and these changes were observed specifically in treatment responders. The findings suggest that microstate C is linked to anhedonia and could serve as a reliable biomarker for personalized rTMS treatment. These results provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying rTMS for anhedonia and highlight the potential of EEG microstate analysis in guiding personalized treatment strategies for depression.

The role of the prefrontal cortex in cocaine-induced noradrenaline release in the nucleus accumbens: a computational study.	Research has extensively explored the role of the dopaminergic system in the reward circuit, while the contribution of the noradrenergic system remains less understood. This study aims to fill this gap by employing computational modeling to examine how the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) influences cocaine-induced norepinephrine (NE) release in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcc), with mediation by the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) and the locus coeruleus (LC). The model replicates previously reported data on NE release in the mPFC following cocaine administration. Additionally, it predicts that NE depletion in the mPFC affects NE release in the NAcc through interactions with the NTS and LC. This work proposes a system-level hypothesis, suggesting that the mPFC regulates NE release in the NAcc by modulating the LC and NTS. These findings enhance our understanding of the neurochemical response to cocaine and offer potential directions for future addiction treatments.

Response of Soil Phage Communities and Prokaryote-Phage Interactions to Long-Term Drought.	Soil moisture is a fundamental factor affecting terrestrial ecosystem functions. In this study, microscopic enumeration and joint metaviromic and metagenomic sequencing were employed together to investigate the impact of prolonged drought on soil phage communities and their interactions with prokaryotes in a subtropical evergreen forest. Our findings revealed a marked reduction in the abundances of prokaryotic and viral-like particles, by 73.1% and 75.2%, respectively, and significantly altered the structure of prokaryotic and phage communities under drought. Meanwhile, drought substantially increased the fraction of prokaryotic communities containing lysogenic phages by 163%, as well as the proportion of temperate phages. Nonetheless, drought likely amplified negative prokaryote-phage interactions given the nearly doubled proportion of negative links in the prokaryote-phage co-occurrence network, as well as the higher frequency and diversity of antiphage defense systems found in prokaryotic genomes. Under drought, soil phages exerted greater top-down control on typical soil	drought; global climate change; host−phage interaction; soil moisture; soil phages

Identification of Depression Subtypes in Parkinson's Disease Patients via Structural MRI Whole-Brain Radiomics: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Study.	Current clinical evaluation may tend to lack precision in detecting depression in Parkinson's disease (DPD). Radiomics features have gradually shown potential as auxiliary diagnostic tools in identifying and distinguishing different subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD), and a radiomic approach that combines unsupervised machine learning has the potential to identify DPD. Analyze the clinical and imaging data of 272 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients from the PPMI dataset, along with 45 PD patients from the NACC dataset. Extract radiomic features from T1-weighted MRI images and employ principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Subsequently, apply four unsupervised clustering methods including Gaussian mixture model (GMM), hierarchical clustering, K-means, and partitioning around medoids (PAM) to classify cases in the PPMI dataset into distinct subtypes. Identify high-risk subtypes of DPD on the basis of the time and number of depression progression, and validate these findings using the NACC dataset. The data from the high-risk subtype were divided into a training subtype and a testing subtype in a 7:3 ratio. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted on the training subtype data to develop a traditional logistic regression model for the high-risk subtype, which was subsequently compared with a supervised logistic regression model constructed for the entire PPMI cohort. Finally, the performance of both models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In addition, a decision tree (DT) model was constructed based on independent risk factors of high-risk subtypes and validated using low-risk subtype data. ROC curves were employed to validate this model across training subtype, testing subtype, and low-risk subtype datasets. The PAM clustering method demonstrates superior performance compared to the other three clustering methods when the number of clusters is 2. High-risk subtypes of DPD can be effectively distinguished in both the PPMI and NACC datasets. A traditional logistic regression model was developed based on rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder, UPDRS I score, UPDRS II score, and ptau in high-risk subgroups. This model exhibits a diagnostic efficacy (AUC = 0.731) that surpasses that of the traditional regression model constructed using the entire PPMI cohort (AUC = 0.674). The prediction model based on high-risk subtypes had AUC values of 0.853 and 0.81 in the training and testing subtypes, sensitivities of 0.765 and 0.786, and specificities of 0.771 and 0.815, respectively. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity in the nonhigh-risk subtype were 0.859, 0.654, and 0.852, respectively. By identifying MRI structural radiomics and clinical features as potential biomarkers, the radiomic approach and UCA provide new insights into the pathophysiology of DPD to support the clinical diagnosis with high prediction accuracy.

Due to the recognition for the importance of early intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important to focus on prevention and treatment strategies for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study aimed to establish a risk prediction model for AD among MCI patients to provide clinical guidance for primary medical institutions. Data from MCI subjects were obtained from the NACC. Importance ranking and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method for the Random Survival Forest (RSF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms in ensemble learning were adopted to select the predictors, and hierarchical clustering analysis was used to mitigate multicollinearity. The RSF, XGBoost and Cox proportional hazard regression (Cox) models were established to predict the risk of AD among MCI patients. Additionally, the effects of the three models were evaluated. A total of 3674 subjects with MCI were included. Thirteen predictors were ultimately identified. In the validation set, the concordance indices were 0.781 (RSF), 0.781 (XGBoost), and 0.798 (Cox), and the Integrated Brier Score was 0.087 (Cox). The prediction effects of the XGBoost and RSF models were not better than those of the Cox model. The ensemble learning method can effectively select predictors of AD risk among MCI subjects. The Cox proportional hazards regression model could be used in primary medical institutions to rapidly screen for the risk of AD among MCI patients once the model is fully clinically validated. The predictors were easy to explain and obtain, and the prediction of AD was accurate.

Associations of late-life blood pressure with CERAD, Braak, and Thal: Findings from the National Alzheimer's coordinating center neuropathology dataset.	Mid-life high blood pressure (BP) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). CERAD amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, Braak tau neurofibrillary tangles, and Thal Aβ plaque location are major scoring systems for quantifying neuropathological features of AD. We examined the association of late-life systolic BP (SBP) with CERAD, Braak, and Thal in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Neuropathology Dataset. Of 1978 participants with data on CERAD, 762 had scores 0-1 (none to sparse) and 1216 had 2-3 (moderate to frequent). Of 1947 with data on Braak, 411 had stages 0-II (normal to mild) and 1536 had III-VI (moderately to very severe). Of 2132 with data on Thal, 438 had phases 0-I, 428 II-III, and 1266 IV-V. Using the mean of the last four SBP before death, SBP was categorized into <120 (references), 120-139, and ≥140 mmHg. Age-sex-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) associated with SBP ≥140 mmHg for CERAD 2-3 and Braak III-VI were 1.37 (1.03, 1.83, P = 0.03) and 1.26 (0.89, 1.78, P = 0.20), respectively. Similar association was observed for Thal II-III and IV-V. These associations essentially remained unchanged after additional adjustment for APOE and Lewy Body pathology. These findings suggest that higher late-life SBP is associated with markers of presence and severity of neuropathological features of AD. Further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm the findings.	Alzheimer's disease; Braak; CERAD; Thal; late‐life blood pressure

Influence of binge drinking on the resting state functional connectivity of university Students: A follow-up study.	Binge Drinking (BD) is characterized by consuming large amounts of alcohol on one occasion, posing risks to brain function. Nonetheless, it remains the most prevalent consumption pattern among students. Cross-sectional studies have explored the relationship between BD and anomalies in resting-state functional connectivity (RS-FC), but the medium/long-term consequences of BD on RS-FC during developmental periods remain relatively unexplored. In this two-year follow-up study, the impact of sustained BD on RS-FC was investigated in 44 college students (16 binge-drinkers) via two fMRI sessions at ages 18-19 and 20-21. Using a seed-to-voxel approach, RS-FC differences were examined in nodes of the main brain functional networks vulnerable to alcohol misuse, according to previous studies. Group differences in RS-FC were observed in four of the explored brain regions. Binge drinkers, compared to the control group, exhibited, at the second assessment, decreased connectivity between the right SFG (executive control network) and right precentral gyrus, the ACC (salience network) and right postcentral gyrus, and the left amygdala (emotional network) and medial frontal gyrus/dorsal ACC. Conversely, binge drinkers showed increased connectivity between the right Nacc (reward network) and four clusters comprising bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right middle cingulate cortex, and right MFG extending to SFG. Maintaining a BD pattern during critical neurodevelopmental years impacts RS-FC, indicating mid-to-long-term alterations in functional brain organization. This study provides new insights into the neurotoxic effects of adolescent alcohol misuse, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies addressing the lasting consequences on brain functional connectivity.

The ongoing opioid crisis underscores the need for innovative treatments targeting neurobiological mechanisms underlying opioid-seeking behaviors and relapse. Here we explored the role of carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4) in modulating synaptic adaptations to oxycodone withdrawal in mice. We disrupted CA4 genetically and inhibited it pharmacologically with acetazolamide (AZD), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used clinically. We found that oxycodone withdrawal increased AMPAR/NMDAR ratio and synaptic recruitment of calcium-permeable AMPARs in nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Synaptic changes required an extended period of abstinence, generalized across opioids including morphine and heroin, were specific to D1 dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs, and were prevented by CA4 disruption.

UK Biobank MRI data can power the development of generalizable brain clocks: A study of standard ML/DL methodologies and performance analysis on external databases.	In this study, we present a comprehensive pipeline to train and compare a broad spectrum of machine learning and deep learning brain clocks, integrating diverse preprocessing strategies and correction terms. Our analysis also includes established methodologies which have shown success in prior UK Biobank-related studies. For our analysis we used T1-weighted MRI scans and processed de novo all images via FastSurfer, transforming them into a conformed space for deep learning and extracting image-derived phenotypes for our machine learning approaches. We rigorously evaluated these approaches both as robust age predictors for healthy individuals and as potential biomarkers for various neurodegenerative conditions, leveraging data from the UK Biobank, ADNI, and NACC datasets. To this end we designed a statistical framework to assess age prediction performance, the robustness of the prediction across cohort variability (database, machine type and ethnicity) and its potential as a biomarker for neurodegenerative conditions. Results demonstrate that highly accurate brain age models, typically utilising penalised linear machine learning models adjusted with Zhang's methodology, with mean absolute errors under 1 year in external validation, can be achieved while maintaining consistent prediction performance across different age brackets and subgroups (e.g., ethnicity and MRI machine/manufacturer). Additionally, these models show strong potential as biomarkers for neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia, where brain age prediction achieved an AUROC of up to 0.90 in distinguishing healthy individuals from those with dementia.

Care Recipients' Cognitive Trajectories and Caregivers' Depressive Symptoms: The Mediating Role of Caregiving Burden.	"The heterogeneity of population-based trajectories of care recipients' (CRs) cognitive functioning and how they are associated with their caregivers' mental health is less studied in the United States. Informed by the stress process model, this study examines the relationship between care recipients' cognitive trajectories and caregivers' depressive symptoms, and the mediating role of caregiving burden. Data were from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (2011-2020) for 1,086 care recipients and their 1,675 caregivers from the 2021 National Study of Caregiving. We applied Bayesian group-based trajectory modeling to identify distinct cognitive trajectory groups among care recipients. Hierarchical linear models were then used to examine the associations between these trajectory group memberships and caregivers' depressive symptoms. Finally, Gelbach decomposition analysis was conducted to investigate the mediating role of physical, emotional, and financial caregiving burden. Five cognitive trajectories were identified among care recipients: ""high start, stable"" (11.81%), ""medium-high start, slight decline"" (31.83%), ""medium start, slight decline"" (27.72%), ""medium-low start, sharp decline"" (20.60%), and ""low start, sharp decline"" (8.04%). Worse cognitive trajectories (e.g., lower baselines and steeper slopes) were associated with increasing caregivers' depressive symptoms; financial, emotional, and physical caregiving burdens jointly explained 63.5% of this association. Emotional caregiving difficulty is the most important contributing caregiving burden, explaining 49.6% of the observed association. When understanding caregiving experiences, it is critical to consider longitudinal cognitive course among care recipients. Interventions targeting multiple aspects of caregiving burden, especially emotional burden, should be prioritized."

Current practices by Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers to remunerate research participants.	Recent guidance from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) recommends remuneration for all Alzheimer's disease (AD) research participants. Given AD research recruitment challenges, we assessed the remuneration practices at Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs). We surveyed 37 ADRCs about remuneration for longitudinal research participants. This included type of remuneration (i.e., compensation, reimbursement) and which study procedures are remunerated. We had a 100% response rate. Most ADRCs (32/37) provide some remuneration but amounts and types varied. Most ADRCs reimburse for travel or food (n = 29), compensate for some study procedures (n = 32), but most do not remunerate study partners (n = 12) or offer financial incentives (n = 8). Few (n = 6) ADRCs pay for all procedures. Two areas for potential change are compensating for annual clinical and cognitive assessments that are compulsory, and for study partners. Evaluation of the impact of remuneration on recruitment and retention is needed, including for underrepresented groups. Recent guidance recommends remuneration for Alzheimer's disease research participants. We surveyed all Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers about their remuneration practices.

Association of Alzheimer's and Lewy body disease pathology with basal forebrain volume and cognitive impairment.	Degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic system is a hallmark feature shared by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) whereas hippocampus atrophy is more specifically related to AD. We aimed to investigate the relationship between basal forebrain and hippocampus atrophy, cognitive decline, and neuropathology in a large autopsy sample. Data were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Basal forebrain and hippocampus volumes were extracted using an established automated MRI volumetry approach. Associations of regional volumes with pathological markers (Braak stage, CERAD score, and McKeith criteria for LB pathology) and cognitive performance were assessed using Bayesian statistical methods. We included people with autopsy-confirmed pure AD (N = 248), pure LBD (N = 22), and mixed AD/LBD (N = 185). Posterior basal forebrain atrophy was most severe in mixed AD/LB pathology compared to pure AD (Bayes factor against the null hypothesis BF In a heterogeneous autopsy sample, AD and LB pathology both contribute to cholinergic basal forebrain degeneration whereas hippocampus atrophy is more specifically related to AD pathology. Cognitive deficits are primarily associated with tau pathology which is partly mediated by hippocampus, but not basal forebrain atrophy.

Early Motor Signs in Pathologically Verified Alzheimer's Disease and Lewy Body Disease.	The neuropathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) commonly co-occur. Parkinsonism is the hallmark feature in LBD but it can be difficult to predict the presence of these co-pathologies early in the course of clinical disease. Timely diagnosis has crucial implications, especially with the advent of disease-modifying therapies. We sought to define early motor features that predict the ultimate neuropathological diagnoses of normal, AD, AD with concurrent LB pathology, and pure LB. We examined the associations between individuals' early motor features from their initial visit using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III and their neuropathological diagnoses using the U.S. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Database. We included data from participants with neuropathologically normal brains (n = 49), AD (n = 502), AD w/LB (n = 167), and pure LB (n = 51). Total UPDRS Part III scores were increasingly higher with purer LB pathology. Decreased facial expression at baseline differentiated those with AD w/LB pathology from those with AD. Participants having pure LB pathology more often had deficits in speech, facial expression, posture, gait, bradykinesia, and upper extremity rigidity relative to those with AD w/LB. Diminished facial expression significantly predicted the presence of LBs among those with concurrent AD pathology. Worse early speech, facial expression, posture, gait, bradykinesia, and upper extremity rigidity were suggestive of more pure LB pathology. These findings emphasize the utility of the neurological exam in the clinical assessment of persons with cognitive complaints as it can guide management.

Internalizing and externalizing symptoms in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently report psychosocial problems, among which internalizing and externalizing symptoms are the most poorly understood due to limited research and inconsistent evidence. This hinders the overall attendance of their psychosocial needs and has a major impact on their quality of life. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize existing findings on the degree to which individuals with NF1 experience internalizing and externalizing symptoms, compared with the unaffected population, and explore moderators of the group disparities. Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, and ProQuest were searched from inception to March 26th, 2024, which identified 59 eligible studies (N of NF1 = 3182, mean ages 2.38 to 46.4 years). Hedges' g was calculated for differences in internalizing and externalizing symptoms between the NF1 group and the unaffected controls. Study effect sizes were pooled using robust variance estimation and random-effects models. Moderators of group differences were tested using meta-regression. Random-effects meta-analyses indicated that compared with unaffected controls, individuals with NF1 showed more severe depressive (k = 21; g = 0.43; 95% CI [0.21, 0.65]), anxiety (k = 24; g = 0.27; 95% CI [0.01, 0.54]), somatic (k = 27; g = 0.56; 95% CI [0.30, 0.83]), total internalizing (k = 75; g = 0.50; 95% CI [0.33, 0.67]), aggression (k = 33; g = 0.33; 95% CI [0.08, 0.58]), delinquency, (k = 37; g = 0.43; 95% CI [0.26, 0.60]), and total externalizing symptoms (k = 47; g = 0.24; 95% CI [0.13, 0.35]). Studies that included more participants with NF1 who had ADHD or a lower verbal IQ reported greater group disparities in total internalizing symptoms or aggression. Findings highlight the importance of promptly recognizing internalizing and externalizing symptoms in individuals with NF1 for timely interventions. Future research should identify predictors of internalizing and externalizing symptoms within the NF1 population to inform our knowledge and intervention development. Other implications for future research were also discussed. The study protocol of this meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42023478258).

Altered asymmetry of amygdala volume mediates food addiction and weight gain.	Food addiction and an impulsive personality can increase overeating, which can lead to weight gain. The amygdala and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are critical for regulating obesogenic behaviour. However, whether the amygdala or the NAcc acts as the neural basis for the regulation of food addiction, impulsive personality, and body weight remains unclear. We examined the differences in the volume of the amygdala and NAcc, especially the lateralization index (LI), between 33 obese participants and 39 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The associations of the LI of each brain region with clinical variables and body mass index (BMI) were identified using network analysis. Finally, we explored the relationships among the LIs of brain regions, impulsive personality, food addiction, and BMI through a multiple chain mediation model. We observed a significant decrease in the LI of the amygdala in the obese group compared with the healthy group (F = 20.276, p < 0.001), which indicates that the right amygdala was larger than the left amygdala in the obese group. Network analysis revealed that the LI of the amygdala was very closely associated with nonplanning impulsivity, food addiction and BMI. The results of the mediation analysis indicated that increased nonplanning impulsiveness could lead to weight gain through increased food addiction (β = 0.069, SE = 0.043, 95% CI [0.014, 0.184]). Moreover, in this symptom chain, the LI of the amygdala can mediate the relationship between food addiction and BMI (β = 0.018, SE = 0.014, 95% CI [0.002, 0.061]). Our observations indicate a substantial reduction in the LI of the amygdala among individuals with obesity, suggesting a structural predisposition. The findings reveal a potential neural mechanism that can help explain the interplay between impulsivity, food addiction, and obesity.	amygdala; food addiction; lateralization; mediation analysis; nonplanning impulsiveness; obesity

Improving estimation efficiency for survival data analysis by integrating a coarsened time-to-event outcome from an external study.	In the era of big data, increasing availability of data makes combining different data sources to obtain more accurate estimations a popular topic. However, the development of data integration is often hindered by the heterogeneity in data forms across studies. In this paper, we focus on a case in survival analysis where we have primary study data with a continuous time-to-event outcome and complete covariate measurements, while the data from an external study contain an outcome observed at regular intervals, and only a subset of covariates is measured. To incorporate external information while accounting for the different data forms, we posit working models and obtain informative weights by empirical likelihood, which will be used to construct a weighted estimator in the main analysis. We have established the theory demonstrating that the new estimator has higher estimation efficiency compared to the conventional ones, and this advantage is robust to working model misspecification, as confirmed in our simulation studies. To assess its utility, we apply our method to accommodate data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center to improve the analysis of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 1 study.	data integration; dementia and Alzheimer’s disease; empirical likelihood; interval censoring; survival analysis

Racial disparities in neuropsychological test performance are well documented in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) but have received little attention in frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). Identification of potential disparities in neuropsychological performance is critical to identify ways to improve inclusivity in clinical research and care of representative FTD populations. We evaluated disparities in neuropsychological performance among individuals with clinically diagnosed FTD (behavioral variant FTD [bvFTD] or primary progressive aphasia [PPA]) using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) collected between September 2005 and November 2023. Only 10% of NACC FTD cases are from racially/ethnically minoritized groups. Black (n=56), Hispanic (n=77) and White (n=1301) individuals were evaluated in the cognitive domains of episodic memory, working memory, processing speed, cognitive flexibility, attention, category fluency and lexical retrieval, in addition to global cognition across Uniform Data Set versions 1 to 3. Linear regressions examined the association between racial/ethnic group and cognitive scores covarying for disease stage, age, sex, and education. After adjusting for age, sex, and education using NACC established normative correction, binary logistic regression examined group differences in the proportion of participants classified as impaired (<=-1.5 normative z-score) for each cognitive test. Minoritized individuals, on average, had lower scores and/or greater likelihood of impairment (odds ratio; OR) on measures of global cognition (Black: β = -3.63; OR = 2.74; Hispanic: β = -2.50), lexical retrieval (Black: β = -4.31; OR = 3.28; Hispanic: β = -2.90; OR = 3.81), processing speed (Black: β = 26.80; OR = 4.07; Hispanic: β = 21.31; OR = 2.37), cognitive flexibility (Black: β = 46.65; OR = 3.35), attention (Hispanic: β = -0.39), working memory (Black: β = -0.79; Hispanic: β = -0.42), episodic memory (Hispanic: β = -1.67), and category fluency (Hispanic: β = -1.28). We did not identify any neuropsychological tests where White individuals performed worse than minoritized individuals. These findings indicate racial/ethnic differences in neuropsychological test performance on measures of global cognition, executive function, and lexical retrieval. Critically, these tests are used in diagnosis and monitoring of FTD. Future efforts must focus on increasing research participation in underrepresented populations with FTD to support the diverse needs of individuals, and an understanding of social determinants of health in FTD to evaluate potential sources of the observed differences across racial and ethnic groups.

Accumbal acetylcholine signals associative salience.	Learning in dynamic environments requires animals to not only associate cues with outcomes but also to determine cue salience, which modulates how quickly related associations are updated. While dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) has been implicated in learning associations, the mechanisms of salience are less understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that acetylcholine (ACh) in the NAcc encodes cue salience. We conducted four odor discrimination experiments in rats while simultaneously measuring accumbal ACh and DA. We found that ACh developed characteristic dips to cues over learning before DA signals differentiated cues by value, with these dips persisting through value decreases and developing faster during meta-learning. The dips reflected the cue salience across learning stages and tasks, as predicted by a hybrid attentional associative learning model that integrated principles from the Mackintosh and Pearce-Hall models, suggesting that accumbal ACh signals encode salience and potentially gate the learning process.	acetylcholine; dopamine; fiber photometry; nucleus accumbens core; salience

Neurotransmitter and metabolic effects of interferon-alpha in association with decreased striatal dopamine in a non-human primate model of cytokine-Induced depression.	Inflammatory stimuli administered to humans and laboratory animals affect mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways in association with impaired motivation and motor activity. Alterations in dopaminergic corticostriatal reward and motor circuits have also been observed in depressed patients with increased peripheral inflammatory markers. The effects of peripheral inflammation on dopaminergic pathways and associated neurobiologic mechanisms and consequences have been difficult to measure in patients. Postmortem tissue (n = 11) from an established, translationally-relevant non-human primate model of cytokine-induced depressive behavior involving chronic interferon-alpha (IFN-a) administration was utilized herein to explore the molecular mechanisms of peripheral cytokine effects on striatal dopamine. Dopamine (but not serotonin or norepinephrine) was decreased in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and putamen of IFN-a-treated animals (p < 0.05). IFN-a had no effect on number of striatal neurons or dopamine terminal density, suggesting no overt neurodegenerative changes. RNA sequencing examined in the caudate, putamen, substantia nigra, and prefrontal cortical subregions revealed that while IFN-a nominally up-regulated limited numbers of genes enriching inflammatory signaling pathways in all regions, robust, whole genome-significant effects of IFN-a were observed specifically in putamen. Genes upregulated in the putamen primarily enriched synaptic signaling, glutamate receptor signaling, and inflammatory/metabolic pathways downstream of IFN-a, including MAPK and PI3K/AKT cascades. Conversely, gene transcripts reduced by IFN-a enriched oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), protein translation, and pathways regulated by dopamine receptors. Unsupervised clustering identified a gene co-expression module in the putamen that was associated with both IFN-a treatment and low dopamine levels, which enriched similar inflammatory, metabolic, and synaptic signaling pathways. IFN-a-induced reductions in dopamine further correlated with genes related to excitotoxic glutamate, kynurenine, and altered dopamine receptor signaling (r = 0.78-97, p < 0.05). These findings provide insight into the immunologic mechanisms and neurobiological consequences of peripheral inflammation effects on dopamine, which may inform novel treatment strategies targeting inflammatory, metabolic or neurotransmitter systems in depressed patients with high inflammation.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms predict rate of change in executive function in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.	Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are considered diagnostic and prognostic indicators of dementia and are attributable to neurodegenerative processes. Little is known about the prognostic value of early NPS on executive functioning (EF) decline in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). We examined whether baseline NPS predicted the rate of executive function (EF) decline among older adults with ADRD. Older adults ( The CUFF models exhibited good fit. EF significantly declined over four waves (slope = -.16, Findings underscore the importance of targeting NPS early across ADRD syndromes to minimize EF decline, offering novel insights into how early NPS treatment may alter cognitive trajectories. We provide an innovative, user-friendly web-based application that may be helpful for personalized treatment planning.

Informing etiological heterogeneity of mild cognitive impairment and risk for progression to dementia with plasma p-tau217.	Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical diagnosis representing early symptom changes with preserved functional independence. There are multiple potential etiologies of MCI. While often presumed to be related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), other neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative causes are common. Wider availability of relatively non-invasive plasma AD biomarkers, such as p-tau217, can provide invaluable insights into MCI clinico-pathology and the associated implications for symptom etiology, prognosis (e.g., risk for progression to dementia), and treatment options. The main goal of this study was to evaluate differences between individuals with MCI with and without plasma p-tau217 biomarker evidence of AD (MCI We conducted an observational cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical research study. Study groups were compared cross-sectionally on demographics, recruitment, clinical measures, and biomarkers (chi square analyses, analyses of covariance). Contributors to functional changes were evaluated with multiple linear regression. Factors associated with the odds of progression from MCI to dementia longitudinally were evaluated with binary logistic regression. 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Cross-sectional analyses included 378 older adults classified as CN Demographics (age, sex, years of education, self-identified race and ethnicity, primary spoken language), National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center-defined clinical phenotypes (Clinically Normal, Impaired - Not MCI, Amnestic MCI, Nonamnestic MCI, Dementia), recruitment source (clinic-based versus community-based), genetics (APOE genotype), functional evaluation (Clinical Dementia Rating scale), global cognition (Mini Mental State Exam), vascular history (Vascular Burden Score), neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q Total score), plasma biomarkers (ALZPath p-tau217, Quanterix Simoa-based GFAP and NfL), and brain imaging (grey matter volume in select AD-relevant regions of interest, global white matter hyperintensity volume). Among those with MCI, 104 (34.4%) had plasma biomarker evidence of AD. MCI MCI is etiologically heterogeneous. The presence of Alzheimer's pathology defined by elevated plasma p-tau217 in individuals with MCI significantly worsens prognosis. Neuropsychiatric symptoms may contribute to cognitive complaints and risk for progressive decline irrespective of AD pathology. Plasma p-tau217 can inform our understanding of base rates of different MCI phenotypes on a larger scale. As with other AD biomarkers, frequency of elevated plasma p-tau217 and odds of progression to dementia requires careful consideration of recruitment source (clinic- vs. community-based), especially across ethno-racially diverse older adults. Ongoing integration of emerging neurodegenerative disease biomarkers with detailed clinical evaluations will continue to improve treatment specificity and prognosis.

Phasic Dopamine Release in the Nucleus Accumbens Influences REM Sleep Timing.	Based on the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons during behavioral states, the DA system has long been thought to be foundational in regulating sleep-wake behavior; over the past decade, advances in circuit manipulation and recording techniques have strengthened this perspective. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that DA release in regions of the limbic system is important in the promotion of REM sleep. Yet how DA dynamics change within bouts of sleep, how these changes are regulated, and whether they influence future state changes remains unclear. To address these questions, in mice of both sexes we used in vivo fiber photometry and inhibitory optogenetics to identify a specific role of DA transients in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in state transitions from NREM sleep. We found that DA transients increase their frequency and amplitude over the duration of NREM sleep and that this increase is more pronounced during NREM bouts that transition into REM sleep. Next, we found that DA transients in NREM sleep are influenced by changes in REM sleep pressure. Finally, we show that transient DA release in the NAcc plays a functional role in regulating the timing of REM sleep entrances, as inhibition of midbrain DA neuron terminals in the NAcc prolonged bouts of NREM sleep and decreased the frequency of bouts of REM sleep. These findings demonstrate that DA release in the NAcc is dynamically regulated by sleep pressure and has a functional role in transitions from NREM sleep, particularly those into REM sleep.

"The Effects of Social Feedback Through the ""Like"" Feature on Brain Activity: A Systematic Review."	"Problematic social media (SM) use is a growing concern, particularly among adolescents who are drawn to these platforms for social interactions important to their age group. SM dependence is characterized by excessive, uncontrolled usage that impairs personal, social, and professional aspects. Despite the ongoing debate over recognizing SM addiction as a distinct diagnostic category, the impact of social feedback, particularly through the ""like"" button, on brain activity remains under scrutiny. This systematic review aims to study the neural correlates of online social feedback, focusing on the effects of the ""like"" feedback on brain activity using fMRI and EEG. The review followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA). The review included 11 studies with 504 participants, identifying key brain structures such as the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and ventral striatum involved in reward processing. Positive feedback (""likes"") activates areas like the nucleus accumbens (NACC), vmPFC, and amygdala, with NACC correlating with increased SM use intensity. Negative feedback activates the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Behavioral data indicates that positive feedback influences subsequent social interactions. The review highlights disparities in the literature regarding the neural response to social feedback, emphasizing the need for further research to clarify the roles of sex, personality traits, and the person giving feedback. Overall, understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of SM engagement is essential for developing effective interventions to prevent or address the negative effects of excessive SM use."

Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies display a signature alteration of their cognitive connectome.	Cognition plays a central role in the diagnosis and characterization of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). However, the complex associations among cognitive deficits in different domains in DLB are largely unknown. To characterize these associations, we investigated and compared the cognitive connectome of DLB patients, healthy controls (HC), and Alzheimer's disease patients (AD). We obtained data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. We built cognitive connectomes for DLB (n = 104), HC (n = 3703), and AD (n = 1985) using correlations among 24 cognitive measures mapping multiple cognitive domains. Connectomes were compared using global and nodal graph measures of centrality, integration, and segregation. For global measures, DLB showed a higher global efficiency (integration) and lower transitivity (segregation) than HC and AD. For nodal measures, DLB showed higher global efficiency in most measures, higher participation (centrality) in free-recall memory, processing speed/attention, and executive measures, and lower local efficiency (segregation) than HC. Compared with AD, DLB showed lower nodal strength and local efficiency, especially in memory consolidation. The cognitive connectome of DLB shows a loss of segregation, leading to a loss of cognitive specialization. This study provides the data to advance the understanding of cognitive impairment and clinical phenotype in DLB, with implications for differential diagnosis.

Phasic dopamine release in two different rat models of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) versus Lphn3 knockout rats.	We examined DA activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) in two Different Rat Models of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) Versus Lphn3 Knockout Rats. We examined baseline stimulation-evoked phasic DA release, half-life, and DA autoreceptor (DAR) functioning in the mPFC and NAcc, as well as the response to nomifensine (10 mg/kg, IP), a DA transporter (DAT) blocker, on these measures in the NAcc. Both rat models were hypodopaminergic, with notable regional and mechanistic differences. The SHRs displayed decreased DA release in the NAcc compared to their control strain (i.e., WKY rats), with no differences in the mPFC, leading a much lower NAcc-to-PFC DA release ratio in SHRs compared to controls suggesting an imbalance in DA transmission between these regions. The Lphn3 KO rats were considered hypodopaminergic based on the reduced summed DA release in the mPFC and NAcc compared to WT controls, although differences were not observed when examining each site independently. Lphn3 KOs displayed increased DA half-life in the mPFC compared with Lphn3 WT rats, an indication of decreased DAT reuptake, with no differences in the NAcc. DAT blockade by nomifensine had a similar effect on DA release in the NAcc of SHRs and WKYs, but increased DA release in the NAcc of Lphn3 KOs to a greater extent than in WTs. These results suggest that the efficacy of pharmacotherapies used to treat externalizing disorders such as ADHD and/or SUD, likely differ between SHRs and Lphn3 KO rats.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with cognitive decline. Use of oral anticoagulant (OAC) medications offers a lower risk of dementia, but it is unclear whether differences exist between types of OAC agents. This was a secondary analysis to explore whether the progression from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment to dementia differs between adults with AF on warfarin versus non-vitamin K inhibitor medications (NOACs) using data extracted from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center clinical case series. Subjects with AF on OACs, having normal cognition and no stroke at baseline, and at least 1 follow-up visit were included. OAC usage was calculated based on follow-up time and reported previous OAC use. Continuation ratio models (with subject-specific random intercepts) were used to examine the association between OAC type and cognitive diagnosis controlling for cognitive diagnosis from previous visit. Among 1475 eligible participants, 478 reported taking warfarin (n = 396) or NOACs (n = 82) at baseline (mean age of 79 years, 51% females, 84% non-Hispanic White). The median follow-up time was 4 years (interquartile range, 2-7). About 63% continued using either warfarin or NOACs, 44% switched from warfarin to NOACs, and 2% switched from NOACs to warfarin. After adjusting for age, sex, education, race, and cardiovascular clinical comorbidities, no significant association was found between OAC type and cognitive decline ( P = .14). We found similar risks of cognitive decline between those on NOACs or warfarin. Future studies should consider effects of age, length of time from AF diagnosis, and OAC adherence on this risk.

Semantic knowledge of social norms in frontotemporal dementia patients with either predominant frontal or temporal lobe atrophy.	Little is known about the relative contribution of frontal and anterior temporal lobes in semantic knowledge of social norms in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Therefore, this study examined performance of FTD patients with either frontal (F-FTD, left temporal (LT-FTD) or bitemporal lobe atrophy (BT-FTD) on the Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ) and explored what accounts for the variance in the SNQ-break norm subscale (i.e., endorsement of inappropriate behaviors). Using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), groups were matched for age and education and included (a) 24 F-FTD patients, (b) 15 LT-FTD patients, (c) 17 BT-FTD patients, and (d) 188 older controls with normal cognition (NC). The BT-FTD group had significantly higher SNQ break norm score than F-FTD and NC groups with a medium effect size, which was also positively associated with the severity personality changes in the real world. Interestingly, the F-FTD and LT-FTD groups performed similarly to the NC group. Regression analysis showed that approximately 21.2% of the variance in SNQ break norms subscale score performance was explained by performance on verb naming. Social inappropriateness in FTD may partially arise from a deficit in knowledge of normative behavior.

Unraveling the clinical-pathological correlations of subjects with isolated and mixed neurodegenerative processes in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset.	"Although Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) is the most common pathology underlying clinical dementia, the presence of multiple comorbid neuropathologies is increasingly being recognized as a major contributor to the worldwide dementia burden. We analyzed 1051 subjects with specific combinations of isolated and mixed pathologies and conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis on a cohort of 4624 cases with mixed pathologies to systematically explore the independent cognitive contributions of each pathology. Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) were both associated with a primary clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) and were characterized by an amnestic dementia phenotype, while only ADNC associated with logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA). In subjects with ADNC and comorbid LATE-NC, Lewy body disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease, the clinical phenotype was usually diagnosed during life as ""Probable AD."" Conversely, the combination of ADNC with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), or corticobasal degeneration (CBD) resulted in a mixed clinical picture, with variable features of amnestic dementia, PPA subtypes, behavioral variant FTD, PSP syndrome, and CBD syndrome. These findings elucidate the cumulative effects of mixed pathologies and provide insights into interactions between neurodegenerative pathologies contributing to a variety of clinical dementia presentations."

Feasibility, validity, and normative data for the remote Uniform Data Set neuropsychological battery at the University of Pennsylvania Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.	We investigated the feasibility and validity of the remotely-administered neuropsychological battery from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (UDS T-Cog). Two hundred twenty Penn Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participants with unimpaired cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia completed the T-Cog during their annual UDS evaluation. We assessed administration feasibility and diagnostic group differences cross-sectionally across telephone versus videoconference modalities, and compared T-Cog to prior in-person UDS scores longitudinally. Administration time averaged 54 min and 79% of participants who initiated a T-Cog completed all 12 subtests; completion time and rates differed by diagnostic group but not by modality. Performance varied expectedly across groups with moderate to strong associations between most T-Cog measures and in-person correlates, although select subtests demonstrated lower comparability. The T-Cog is feasibly administered and shows preliminary validity in a cognitively heterogeneous cohort. Normative data from this cohort should be expanded to more diverse populations to enhance utility and generalizability. This study examined the feasibility and validity of the remote Uniform Data Set (also known as the T-Cog) and contributes key normative data for widespread use.A remote neuropsychological battery was feasibly administered with high overall engagement and completion rates, adequate reliability compared to in-person testing, and evidence of validity across diagnostic groups.Typical barriers to administration included hearing impairment, technology issues, and distractions; hearing difficulties were particularly common among cognitively impaired groups.Certain tests were less closely related to their in-person correlates and should be used with caution.

Disrupting heroin-associated memory reconsolidation through actin polymerization inhibition in the nucleus accumbens core.	Understanding drug addiction as a disorder of maladaptive learning, where drug-associated or environmental cues trigger drug cravings and seeking, is crucial for developing effective treatments. Actin polymerization, a biochemical process, plays a crucial role in drug-related memory formation, particularly evident in conditioned place preference paradigms involving drugs like morphine and methamphetamine. However, the role of actin polymerization in the reconsolidation of heroin-associated memories remains understudied. This study employed a rodent model of self-administered heroin to investigate the involvement of actin polymerization in the reconsolidation of heroin-associated memories. Rats underwent ten days of intravenous heroin self-administration paired with conditioned cues. Subsequently, a 10-day extinction phase aimed to reduce heroin-seeking behaviors. Following this, rats participated in a 15-minute retrieval trial with or without cues. Immediately post-retrieval, rats received bilateral injections of the actin polymerization inhibitor Latrunculin A (Lat A) into the nucleus accumbens core (NACc), a critical brain region for memory reconsolidation. Immediate administration of Lat A into the NACc post-retrieval significantly reduced cue-induced and heroin-primed reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior for at least 28 days. However, administering Lat A 6-hour post-retrieval or without a retrieval trial, as well as administering Jasplakionlide prior to memory reactivation did not affect heroin-seeking behaviors. Inhibiting actin polymerization during the reconsolidation window disrupts heroin-associated memory reconsolidation, leading to decreased heroin-seeking behavior and prevention of relapse. These effects are contingent upon the presence of a retrieval trial and exhibit temporal specificity, shedding light on addiction mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions.	actin polymerization; heroin; nucleus accumbens core; rats; reconsolidation

Association of APOE alleles and polygenic profiles comprising APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 variants with Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging markers.	TOMM40 and APOC1 variants can modulate the APOE-ε4-related Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk by up to fourfold. We aim to investigate whether the genetic modulation of ε4-related AD risk is reflected in brain morphology. We tested whether 27 magnetic resonance imaging-derived neuroimaging markers of neurodegeneration (volume and thickness in temporo-limbic regions) are associated with APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 polygenic profiles using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set linked to the AD Genetic Consortium data. All brain regions studied using structural phenotypes were smaller in individuals with AD. The ε4 allele was associated with smaller limbic (entorhinal, hippocampus, parahippocampus) brain volume and cortical thickness in AD cases than controls. There were significant differences in the associations for the higher-risk and lower-risk ε4-bearing APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 profiles with temporo-limbic region markers. The APOE-AD heterogeneity may be partly attributed to the modulating role of the TOMM40 and APOC1 genes in the APOE cluster. The ε4 allele is associated with smaller values of neuroimaging markers in AD cases. Larger values of neuroimaging markers may protect against AD in the ε4 carriers. TOMM40 and APOC1 variants differentiate AD risk in the ε4 carriers. The same variants can differentiate the links between ε4 and neuroimaging markers.

Factors associated with care-resistant behavior in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set.	Little is known about the factors associated with care-resistant behavior in community-dwelling persons living with dementia. Regression modeling was performed on 41,143 responses to a standardized questionnaire from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set. In the fully adjusted mixed-effects regression model, collinearity was low, with no variance inflation factor above 1.15. Moderate (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50, 1.69) and severe (aOR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.82, 2.09) dementia severity; and Black (aOR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.47, 1.82), Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.28), frontotemporal (aOR 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.49) and Lewy body dementia (aOR 1.15; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.29) diagnosis type were associated with a higher odds of care-resistant behavior. Female sex (aOR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.91) and higher education (aOR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.97) were associated with lower odds of care-resistant behavior. Interventions to manage care-resistant behaviors should consider sociocultural factors as well as type of dementia diagnosis to limit caregiver strain and burden. Frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, and Black race were associated with a higher likelihood of exhibiting care-resistant behavior. Female sex and higher educational attainment were associated with a lower likelihood of exhibiting care-resistant behavior. Differences in specific presentations of care-resistant behaviors are less understood.	care‐resistant behavior; dementia diagnosis; disparities

Lewy body co-pathology in Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy contributes to differential neuropathological, cognitive, and brain atrophy patterns.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) co-pathology with Lewy bodies (LB) is frequent and influences clinical manifestations and outcomes. Its significance in primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is unknown. We investigated the influence of LB on cognition and brain atrophy in AD and PART. We performed a retrospective cohort study in a large sample of autopsied participants with AD neuropathological change (ADNC) with and without LB and PART with and without LB, with corresponding ante mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset. LB co-pathology worsened cognitive impairment in both PART and ADNC. On longitudinal follow-up, LB impacted cognitive decline in multiple domains. Additionally, LB influenced brain atrophy on MRI across groups and LB regional staging was different in PART and ADNC, accompanying tauopathy progression. These results suggest that LB co-pathology is associated with divergent patterns of cognitive impairment, brain atrophy, and regional pathological distribution in PART and AD. Lewy body (LB) co-pathology is frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with important clinical implications. LB co-pathology is also present in primary age-related tauopathy (PART), but its significance is still understudied. In PART and AD, LB leads to higher cognitive impairment and brain regional atrophy. In PART and AD, LB tends to accompany neurofibrillary tangle progression, suggesting amyloid pathology might be a trigger for regional pathology progression.

Sex and APOE ε4 allele differences in longitudinal white matter microstructure in multiple cohorts of aging and Alzheimer's disease.	The effects of sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE)-Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors-on white matter microstructure are not well characterized. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data from nine well-established longitudinal cohorts of aging were free water (FW)-corrected and harmonized. This dataset included 4741 participants (age = 73.06 ± 9.75) with 9671 imaging sessions over time. FW and FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FA Sex differences in FA There are prominent differences in white matter microstructure by sex and APOE ε4 carrier status. This work adds to our understanding of disparities in AD. Additional work to understand the etiology of these differences is warranted. Sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status relate to white matter microstructural integrity. Females generally have lower free water-corrected fractional anisotropy compared to males. APOE ε4 carriers tended to have higher free water than non-carriers.	Alzheimer's disease; aging; sex differences; white matter disease

Cognitive decline profiles associated with lewy pathology in the context of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change.	Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and Lewy pathology (LP) often coexist in cognitively impaired individuals. These pathologies' relative distribution and severity may modify these individuals' clinical presentation, cognitive profile, and prognosis. Therefore, we examined the contributions of LP and concomitant ADNC to disease survival and profiles of cognitive decline in preclinical and clinical stages in a large neuropathologically diagnosed group. We evaluated 597 participants with LP and 491 participants with intermediate/high ADNC in the absence of LP from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) database. At baseline, 237 participants were cognitively normal (CN), 255 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 596 with dementia. Cognition was assessed using three cognitive domain scores (i.e., Memory, Executive, and Language) from the NACC Uniform Dataset (UDS) neuropsychological test battery, MMSE, and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Multivariate adaptive regression splines were used to evaluate associations between baseline cognitive scores and mean annual rate of change over two years. The likelihood of progression to MCI or dementia was assessed using Cox hazard models. Neocortical LP, independent of the clinical diagnosis, was associated with lower Executive and higher Language and Memory scores at baseline, whereas Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology was associated with lower Memory and Language scores. Similarly, neocortical LP was associated with faster Executive decline, whereas Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology was associated with faster Memory and Language decline. A clinical diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia (i.e., a strong LP phenotype) was associated with the LP cognitive profile and shorter disease duration. Progression to incident MCI or dementia was primarily associated with the degree of tau pathology; neocortical LP or a diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia only predicted progression when those with intermediate/high ADNC were excluded. LP and ADNC differentially affected cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive profiles in a large autopsy sample. Concomitant Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology had a strong impact on clinical progression in those with LP, regardless of the initial stage. Thus, LB and ADNC co-pathology interact to affect cognitive domains that may be used to track Lewy Body disease longitudinally and as outcome measures in therapeutic trials.

Brain Activation Associated With Response to Psychotherapies for Late-Life Depression: A Task-Based fMRI Study.	The course of late-life depression is associated with functioning of multiple brain networks. Understanding the brain mechanisms associated with response to psychotherapy can inform treatment development and a personalized treatment approach. This study examined how activation of key regions of the salience network, default mode network and reward systems is associated with response to psychotherapies for late-life depression. Thirty-three older adults with major depressive disorder were randomized to 9 weeks of Engage or Problem-Solving Therapy for late-life depression. Participants completed a Probabilistic Reversal Learning task in the MRI at baseline and Week 6. We focused on focal activation in regions of interest selected a priori: the subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC; DMN); the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; salience network and reward system); and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc; reward system). We applied mixed-effects regression models to examine whether brain activation was associated with psychotherapy response. We found that at baseline, low activation of the dACC and the sgACC was associated with lower depression severity over 6 weeks of psychotherapy. In addition, we observed significant time*activation interactions, such that after 6 weeks of psychotherapy, lower dACC activation and higher NAcc and sgACC activation were each associated with lower depression severity. Further, we found that baseline slower response to negative feedback and faster response to positive feedback was associated with lower depression severity over 6 weeks of psychotherapy. Our findings suggest that activation of reward, salience, and DMN regions may serve as markers of response during psychotherapy for late-life depression. Engagement of these networks may be linked to treatment outcome. Personalized psychotherapies can target individuals' brain profiles to improve outcomes for older adults with major depression. This study examined whether activation of regions of the reward, salience and default mode networks is associated with response to psychotherapies for late-life depression. We found that baseline low activation of the dACC and the sgACC was associated with lower depression severity during psychotherapy. We also found that at week 6, lower dACC activation and higher NAcc and sgACC activation were linked with lower depression severity. These regions may represent promising brain mechanisms for future personalized interventions.	Late-life depression; brain activation; depression; fMRI; personalization; psychotherapy

Improving dementia prognostication in cognitively normal older adults: conventional versus novel approaches to modelling risk associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms.	Studies in cognitively normal individuals on associations between psychiatric symptomatology and incident dementia have not reliably differentiated psychiatric syndromes from neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) that represent neurodegeneration. Conventional modelling often overlooks symptom natural history. Mild behavioural impairment (MBI) is a syndrome that leverages later-life emergent and persistent NPS to identify a high-risk group for incident dementia. We aimed to explore associations of MBI, and conventionally-measured NPS (NPS-not-MBI), with incident dementia in cognitively normal individuals and the cognitively normal subset with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Using National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data, MBI was operationalised by the absence of past psychiatric disorders (symptom emergence) and the presence of symptoms at >2/3 of pre-dementia visits (symptom persistence). Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regressions modelled dementia incidence across NPS groups and MBI domains, adjusted for age, gender, education, race, APOE-ε4, and cognitive status. The sample comprised 1408 MBI (age 75.2 ± 9.5; 54.3% female), 5625 NPS-not-MBI (age 71.6 ± 8.8; 65.5% female) and 5078 No-NPS (age 71.2 ± 8.9; 67.6% female) participants. Compared with No-NPS, MBI participants had lower dementia-free survival ( Incorporating natural history into assessment of psychiatric symptoms in accordance with MBI criteria enhances dementia prognostication and modelling.

HIV drug resistance following pre-exposure prophylaxis failure among key populations in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.	"Key populations (KP) are highly vulnerable to HIV acquisition and account for 70% of new infections worldwide. To optimize HIV prevention among KP, the World Health Organization recommends the combination of emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, PrEP failure could be attributed to drug resistance mutations (DRMs) but this is unexplored in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We aim to conduct a systematic review that will provide evidence on the prevalence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) following PrEP failure among KP in SSA. This will be a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. This systematic review will include randomized and non-randomized trials, cohorts, case controls, cross-sectional studies, and case reports evaluating the prevalence of HIVDR following PrEP failure among KP (i.e., gay men and men who have sex with men, female sex workers, transgenders, people who inject drugs, prisoners, and detainees) in SSA. Results will be stratified according to various KP, age groups (adolescents and adults), and geographic locations. Primary outcomes will be ""the prevalence of PrEP failure among KP"" and ""the prevalence of HIVDR after PrEP failure"" in SSA. Secondary outcomes would be ""the prevalence of DRMs and drug susceptibility"" and ""the level of adherence to PrEP."" A random-effects model will be used to calculate pooled prevalence if data permit and we will explore potential sources of heterogeneity. Our findings will provide estimates of HIVDR following PrEP failure among KP in SSA. In addition, determinants of PrEP failure and driving factors of the emergence of DRMs will also be investigated. Evidence will help in selecting effective antiretrovirals for use in PrEP among KP in SSA. PROSPERO: CRD42023463862."

Evaluating the factor structure and construct validity of the NIH toolbox in older adults, with a focus on cognitive normalcy and amnestic mild cognitive impairment: considerations for diversity, including insights from persons over 85 years of age and Black older Americans.	Validated computerized assessments for cognitive functioning are crucial for older individuals and those at risk of cognitive decline. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB) exhibits good construct validity but requires validation in diverse populations and for adults aged 85+. This study uses data from the Assessing Reliable Measurement in Alzheimer's Disease and cognitive Aging study to explore differences in the factor structure of the NIHTB-CB for adults 85 and older, Black participants versus White participants, and those diagnosed as amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) vs cognitively normal (CN). Subtests from the NACC UDS-3 and NIHTB-CB were administered to 503 community-dwelling Black and White adults ages 55-99 (367 CN; 136 aMCI). Confirmatory factor analyses were used to investigate the original factor structure of NIHTB-CB that forms the basis for NIHTB-CD Index factor scores. Factor analyses for all participants and some participant subsets (aMCI, White, 85+) substantiated the two anticipated factors (Fluid and Crystallized). However, while Black aMCI participants had the expected two-factor structure, for Black CN participants, the List Sorting Working Memory and Picture Sequence tests loaded on the Crystallized factor. Findings provide psychometric support for the NIHTB-CB. Differences in factor structure between Black CN individuals and Black aMCI individuals suggest potential instability across levels of cognitive impairment. Future research should explore changes in NIHTB-CB across diagnoses in different populations.	Alzheimer’s; Black Americans; Factor analysis; cognition; cognitive aging; cognitive impairment

A Dynamic Model for Early Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease by Leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks and Tensor Algebra.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurocognitive disorder that deteriorates memory and impairs cognitive functions. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is generally considered as an intermediate phase between normal cognitive aging and more severe conditions such as AD. Although not all individuals with MCI will develop AD, they are at an increased risk of developing AD. Diagnosing AD once strong symptoms are already present is of limited value, as AD leads to irreversible cognitive decline and brain damage. Thus, it is crucial to develop methods for the early prediction of AD in individuals with MCI. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)-based methods have been effectively used to predict the progression from MCI to AD by analyzing electronic health records (EHR). However, despite their widespread use, existing RNN-based tools may introduce increased model complexity and often face difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies. In this study, we introduced a novel Dynamic deep learning model for Early Prediction of AD (DyEPAD) to predict MCI subjects' progression to AD utilizing EHR data. In the first phase of DyEPAD, embeddings for each time step or visit are captured through Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and aggregation functions. In the final phase, DyEPAD employs tensor algebraic operations for frequency domain analysis of these embeddings, capturing the full scope of evolutionary patterns across all time steps. Our experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms or is in par with the state-of-the-art and baseline methods.

Identification and Correlation Analysis of Ferroptosis-Related Genes in Three Brain Regions of Patients with Schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental disorder that is marked by hallucinations and cognitive impairments. Ferroptosis is a type of cell death that is associated with iron and lipid peroxidation; it may play a role in SZ etiology. The present study aimed to explore the correlations between ferroptosis-related genes and SZ in three brain regions. We used the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset GSE80655 to analyze brain samples from SZ patients and controls; specifically, we evaluated the anterior cingulate cortex (Ancg), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and nucleus accumbens (nAcc). The data were preprocessed in R, and ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Pearson correlation analysis was then performed to assess correlations between these DEGs and age at death, postmortem interval, or brain pH. To identify important ferroptosis-related genes, we created a protein-protein interaction network using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database, and visualized it using Cytoscape software. Moreover, the pROC package was used to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for these important genes. Finally, gene set variation analysis was used for the pathway enrichment analysis of ferroptosis-related pathways, followed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Nine ferroptosis-related DEGs were upregulated in the Ancg region and one was downregulated in the nAcc region. In the Ancg region, the SZ group had four ferroptosis-related DEGs that were negatively correlated with postmortem interval, and the control group had five ferroptosis-related DEGs that were negatively correlated with brain pH. The protein-protein interaction network analysis of the Ancg region revealed seven significant interacting genes; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) and galectin 3 (LGALS3) were the hub genes. Gene set variation analysis revealed substantial changes in the glycolysis pathway in the Ancg region, and in the glutamate transmembrane transport pathway and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis process pathway in the nAcc region, in SZ patients compared with controls. The correlation between ferroptosis and SZ appears to be stronger in the Ancg than in the nAcc or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This association may be mediated by TIMP1 and LGALS3 as well as by the glycolysis pathway, indicating that these might be possible biomarkers for SZ.

Dopamine dynamics in chronic pain: music-induced, sex-dependent, behavioral effects in mice.	Chronic pain is a debilitating disease that is usually comorbid to anxiety and depression. Current treatment approaches mainly rely on analgesics but often neglect emotional aspects. Nonpharmacological interventions, such as listening to music, have been incorporated into clinics to provide a more comprehensive management of chronic pain. However, the underlying mechanisms of music-mediated pain relief are not fully understood. Our aim was to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of music exposure in an animal model of chronic pain. We injected mice with the complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) inflammatory agent into the hind paw and housed them for 14 days with background music, or ambient noise, during their active period (Mozart K.205, overnight). The effect of music exposure on nociception, anxiety-like behaviors, and depression-like behaviors was evaluated through different paradigms, including the hot plate, Von Frey, elevated plus maze, splash, and tail suspension tests. In addition, we conducted fiber photometry experiments to investigate whether music influences dopamine dynamics in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a crucial region involved in pain processing, anhedonia, and reward. Our findings indicate that music exposure prevents the decrease in NAcc activity observed in CFA-injected mice, linking with a sex-dependent reduction in allodynia, anxiety-like behaviors, and depression-like behaviors. Accordingly, female mice were more sensitive to music exposure than male mice. Collectively, our findings provide compelling evidence for the integration of music as a nonpharmacological intervention in chronic pain conditions. Moreover, the observed effect on NAcc suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for addressing chronic pain and its associated symptoms.

Comorbidities in early-onset sporadic versus presenilin-1 mutation-associated Alzheimer disease dementia: Evidence for dependency on Alzheimer disease neuropathological changes.	Studying comorbidities in early onset Alzheimer disease (AD) may provide an advantageous perspective on their pathogenesis because aging factors may be largely inoperative for these subjects. We compared AD comorbidities between early-onset sporadic cases and American and Colombian cases with PSEN1 mutations. AD neuropathological changes (ADNC) were very severe in all groups but more severe in the PSEN1 groups. Lewy body disease and cerebral white matter rarefaction were the most common (up to 60%) of AD comorbidities, followed by arteriolosclerosis (up to 37%), and large-vessel atherosclerosis (up to 20%). Differences between the 3 groups included earlier age of onset in the American PSEN1 cases, shorter disease duration in sporadic cases, and more frequent large-vessel atherosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the Colombian PSEN1 cases. Logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex found the presence of a PSEN1 mutation, an apolipoprotein ε4 allele and TDP-43 pathology to predict an earlier age of onset; Hispanic ethnicity and multiracial subjects were predictive of severe CAA. Comorbidities are common in early onset AD and should be considered when planning clinical trials with such subjects. However, they may be at least partially dependent on ADNC and thus potentially addressable by anti-amyloid or and/anti-tau therapies.

Deep learning reveals pathology-confirmed neuroimaging signatures in Alzheimer's, vascular and Lewy body dementias.	Concurrent neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies pose a diagnostic challenge in the clinical setting, with histopathology remaining the definitive modality for dementia-type diagnosis. To address this clinical challenge, we introduce a neuropathology-based, data-driven, multi-label deep learning framework to identify and quantify in-vivo biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), and Lewy body dementia (LBD) using antemortem T1-weighted MRI scans of 423 demented and 361 control participants from NACC and ADNI datasets. Based on the best-performing deep learning model, explainable heatmaps are extracted to visualize disease patterns, and the novel Deep Signature of Pathology Atrophy REcognition (DeepSPARE) indices are developed, where a higher DeepSPARE score indicates more brain alterations associated with that specific pathology. A substantial discrepancy in clinical and neuropathology diagnosis was observed in the demented patients: 71% of them had more than one pathology, but 67% of them were clinically diagnosed as AD only. Based on these neuropathology diagnoses and leveraging cross-validation principles, the deep learning model achieved the best performance with a balanced accuracy of 0.844, 0.839, and 0.623 for AD, VD, and LBD, respectively, and was used to generate the explainable deep-learning heatmaps and DeepSPARE indices. The explainable deep-learning heatmaps revealed distinct neuroimaging brain alteration patterns for each pathology: the AD heatmap highlighted bilateral hippocampal regions, the VD heatmap emphasized white matter regions, and the LBD heatmap exposed occipital alterations. The DeepSPARE indices were validated by examining their associations with cognitive testing, neuropathological, and neuroimaging measures using linear mixed-effects models. The DeepSPARE-AD index was associated with MMSE, Trail B, memory, PFDR-adjustedhippocampal volume, Braak stages, CERAD scores, and Thal phases (PFDR-adjusted < 0.05). The DeepSPARE-VD index was associated with white matter hyperintensity volume and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (PFDR-adjusted < 0.001). The DeepSPARE-LBD index was associated with Lewy body stages (PFDR-adjusted < 0.05). The findings were replicated in an out-of-sample ADNI dataset by testing associations with cognitive, imaging, plasma, and CSF measures. CSF and plasma pTau181 were significantly associated with DeepSPARE-AD in the AD/MCIΑβ+ group (PFDR-adjusted < 0.001), and CSF α-synuclein was associated solely with DeepSPARE-LBD (PFDR-adjusted = 0.036). Overall, these findings demonstrate the advantages of our innovative deep-learning framework in detecting antemortem neuroimaging signatures linked to different pathologies. The newly deep learning-derived DeepSPARE indices are precise, pathology-sensitive, and single-valued noninvasive neuroimaging metrics, bridging the traditional widely available in-vivo T1 imaging with histopathology.

How interoceptive sensibility moderates decision-making: an fMRI study of neuroforecasting mobile games engagement.	Neuroscientists in decision science have advanced an affect-integration-motivation (AIM) framework, demonstrating that neural activity associated with positive affect or value integration can predict individual and aggregate choice. Given that individuals with higher interoceptive sensibility (IS) have tendency to engage their bodily sensations and thus exhibit a more coherent pattern between their neural, affective, and behavioral measures, we investigated how IS may interact with the affective/integrative components for predicting individual and aggregate choice. Thus, we 1) explored neural underpinnings of individual choice, affective ratings, aggregate outcomes, 2) examined how the above-mentioned measures predict individual and aggregate choices on mobile games, and 3) tested the moderation effect of IS by comparing the differences in how these measures perform in prediction models between subgroups of IS. Neuroimaging results showed that individual choice associated with NAcc activity, aggregate download rate tracked by regions in salience network, and revenue additionally tracked by regions in motor tendency and attention regulation. Affective ratings and AIns activity predicted individual download choice; mPFC activity forecasted aggregate download rate, and positive arousal forecasted aggregate revenue. As hypothesized, the high IS group displayed coherent correlations between affective ratings, individual choice, and neural measures. More importantly, at the aggregate level, mPFC activity (integrative component), forecasted aggregate download rate above and beyond ratings and individual choice in the high IS group, with this prediction significantly stronger compared with the low IS group. These findings extend the AIM framework by shedding light on the influence of interoceptive sensibility on the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying human decision-making.

Distinct medical and substance use histories associate with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease.	Phenotype clustering reduces patient heterogeneity and could be useful when designing precision clinical trials. We hypothesized that the onset of early cognitive decline in patients would exhibit variance predicated on the clinical history documented prior to an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis. Self-reported medical and substance use history (i.e., problem history) was used to cluster participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centers (NACC) into distinct subtypes. Linear mixed effects modeling was used to determine the effect of problem history subtype on cognitive decline over two years. 2754 individuals were partitioned into three subtypes: minimal (n = 1380), substance use (n = 1038), and cardiovascular (n = 336) subtypes. The cardiovascular problem history subtype had significantly worse cognitive decline over a two-year follow-up period (p = 0.013). Our study highlights the need to account for problem history to reduce heterogeneity of outcomes in AD clinical trials.

Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent psychostimulant that interferes the functionality of various brain regions and nervous connections, leading to addiction. The nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), primarily composed of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) neurons, serves as a critical nucleus intimately related to addictive behavior. Previous research has indicated the involvement of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors in drug addiction, yet the precise function of CCK receptors within the neural circuitry mediating METH-induced addiction remains elusive. METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) model was established in mice. In CCK receptor 1 conditional knockout (CCK1R During the acquisition of METH-induced CPP, the expression of CCK1R, but not CCK2R, was upregulated specifically in NAcC. Genetic disruption of either CCK1R in the NAcC effectively hindered METH-induced CPP acquisition and prevented the hyper-excitability of neurons triggered by METH. Furthermore, CCK is released by dopaminergic neurons in the VTA, projecting to the NAcC. Notably, specifically knocking out CCK1R in the VTA These discoveries highlight the critical effect of CCK1R in the VTA	Cholecystokinin receptor 1; Conditioned place preference; Methamphetamine; Neuronal excitability; Nucleus accumbens core; Synaptic plasticity

Cerebral hypoperfusion reduces tau accumulation.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) often coexists with cerebrovascular diseases. However, the impact of cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke on AD pathology remains poorly understood. This study examines the correlation between cerebrovascular diseases and AD pathology. The research was carried out using clinical and neuropathological data collected from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database and an animal model in which bilateral common carotid artery stenosis surgery was performed, following the injection of tau seeds into the brains of wild-type mice. Analysis of the NACC database suggests that clinical stroke history and lacunar infarcts are associated with lower neurofibrillary tangle pathology. An animal model demonstrates that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion reduces tau pathology, which was observed in not only neurons but also astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, we found that astrocytes and microglia were activated in response to tau pathology and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Additionally, cerebral hypoperfusion increased a lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin D. These data together indicate that cerebral hypoperfusion reduces tau accumulation likely through an increase in microglial phagocytic activity towards tau and an elevation in degradation through cathepsin D. This study contributes to understanding the relationship between tau pathology and cerebrovascular diseases in older people with multimorbidity.

Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Associated With Frontotemporal Atrophy in Older Adults Without Dementia.	We investigated the association between neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and frontotemporal atrophy (FTA) in older adults without dementia. We hypothesized that the odds of having NPS would be increased in the presence of FTA. NACC participants ≥ 50 years old with available data on FTA were considered for eligibility. Those with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and those who were cognitively unimpaired (CU) were separately analyzed. NPS were quantified on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. Binary logistic regression models estimated the association (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are provided) between FTA and having each of 11 NPS (psychotic symptoms were grouped together) in CU and MCI individuals. FTA data were available for 3165 participants with MCI and 4051 CU: 207 and 55 had FTA on structural MRI studies, respectively. In the MCI group, the presence of FTA was associated with higher odds of having elation [2.42(1.33-4.40), p = 0.004], aberrant motor behavior [2.43(1.61-3.69), p < 0.001], appetite disorders [2.15(1.52-3.04), p < 0.001], apathy [2.05(1.48-2.85), p < 0.001] and disinhibition [2.02(1.38-2.96), p < 0.001]. The odds of having specific NPS were not significantly elevated in CU individuals with FTA. Of note, the size and direction of the associations were indicative of a potential relationship between FTA and specific NPS (most notably elation, aberrant motor behavior, appetite disorders and anxiety); in light of the small number of CU individuals with FTA we believe this analysis was underpowered and obscured several true associations. FTA was associated with higher odds of some NPS in older adults with MCI but not with normal cognition.	aberrant motor behavior; apathy; appetite disorders; disinhibition; elation

Studies that assess the effects of the interaction of psychoactive substances on dopamine release, the key neurotransmitter in the neurochemical and behavioral effects related to drug consumption, are crucial to understand both their roles and the dysfunctions they produce in the central nervous system. We evaluated the effects of individual and combined administration of the three most widely consumed psychoactive substances in the world, ethanol, caffeine, and nicotine, on dopaminergic neurotransmission in three brain regions of rats related to addiction: the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and the dorsal striatum. The dopamine levels were measured in vivo by cerebral microdialysis associated with HPLC-ED. We observed that local administration of a single concentration of caffeine (5 mM) or nicotine (5 mM) significantly increased the dopamine levels in all three areas studied, while ethanol (300 mM) increased them in the NAcc and striatum. Perfusion of nicotine + caffeine produced a synergistic effect in both the NAcc and striatum, with increases in the in vivo dopamine release greater than the sum of the effects of both substances. When administering the combination of nicotine + caffeine + ethanol, we observed an additive effect in the NAcc, while in the PFC we observed a synergistic effect. Our results support the stimulating effects of caffeine, nicotine, and ethanol on the brain reward system. In addition, we also observed that the administration of different mixtures of these substances produces synergistic and additive effects on the release of dopamine in the mesocortical and nigrostriatal systems.	dopamine and drugs; microdialysis; neuromodulation; psychoactive substances; rat; signaling pathways

The Consortium for Clarity in ADRD Research Through Imaging (CLARiTI).	The presence of multiple pathologies is the largest predictor of dementia. A major gap in the field is the in vivo detection of mixed pathologies and their antecedents. The Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) are uniquely positioned to address this gap. The ADRCs longitudinally follow ≈ 17,000 participants, ranging from cognitively unimpaired to dementia, arising from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD; e.g., AD, Lewy body disorders, vascular). Motivated by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative's (ADNI) impact, the ADRC Consortium for Clarity in ADRD Research Through Imaging (CLARiTI) was formed. Leveraging existing ADRC infrastructure, CLARiTI will integrate standardized imaging and plasma collection to characterize mixed pathologies and use community-engaged research methods to ensure that ≥ 25% of the sample is from underrepresented populations (e.g., ethnoculturally minoritized, low education). The resulting ADRD profiles, within a more diverse sample, will provide key resources for ADRCs and an unprecedented, more generalizable publicly available imaging-plasma dataset. HIGHLIGHTS: In vivo detection of mixed pathologies is critical for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias research. The Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) are uniquely positioned to address gaps related to mixed pathologies. The ADRC Consortium for Clarity in ADRD Research Through Imaging (CLARiTI) will enhance this national program by adding standardized imaging and plasma collection to existing ADRC infrastructure. This effort will provide key resources for ADRCs and an unprecedented publicly available imaging-plasma-neuropath dataset.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy impacts neurofibrillary tangle burden and cognition.	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy commonly co-occurs with amyloid β plaques and neurofibrillary degeneration and is proposed to contribute to cognitive impairment. However, the interplay among these pathologic changes of Alzheimer disease is not well understood. Here we replicate and extend findings of a recent study that suggested the association of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cognitive impairment is mediated by neurofibrillary degeneration. We employed similar approaches but in a larger, clinical-based (as opposed to community-based) set of 4915 autopsied National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center participants (60% with dementia). Neuropathologic lesions were measured ordinally; longitudinal change in cognition was used to measure cognitive impairment. Statistical analyses included ordinal logistic regression, mediation analyses and extension of models to include presence of	Alzheimer’s disease; dementia; neurodegeneration; neuropathology

Anti-Hypertensives Reduce the Rate of Alzheimer's Disease Progression: A Cohort Study Linked with Genetic and Neuropathological Analyses.	Arterial hypertension contributes to both the development and progression of dementia due to both Alzheimer's disease (A.D.) and vascular pathology. However, the effects of different classes of anti-hypertensives (A.H.T.s), on the rate of dementia progression and brain neuropathology are unknown. To investigate the effect of each class of A.H.T., both as single and combined, on the rate of dementia progression. In addition, we analyzed the effect of A.H.T.s on brain neuropathology in AD participants, indicated by Braak staging, hippocampal atrophy, and baseline CSF levels of A-β42, total (T) tau, and P-181 tau. We have used the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS). A.H.T.s were associated with reduced yearly increase in the CDR-SOB scores of 1.025 during a 10-year follow-up (P<0.001). The overall survival rate was higher in A.H.T. users than non-users [HR: 0.912: 0.860, 0.967) P=0.002]. These trends continued when stratifying participants by age, gender, and APOE4 allele. Participants who did not use A.H.T.s had a mean yearly increase of 1.71±1.7 in the CDR-SOB scores. This value was reduced to 1.48±1.6, P=0.006 and 1.45±1.6, P=0.024 for participants with documented use of βB and A.R.B.s, respectively. Combining diuretics with α1-AB or ACEI led to synergistic effects in reducing the rise in CDR-SOB scores. The proportion of participants who were diagnosed having AD postmortem with severe Braak staging was significantly lower in A.H.T.-users than non-users. The severity of Braak staging, and hippocampal atrophy differed in participants> 70 vs. <70 years old, in both males and females. A significant relationship was observed between hippocampal atrophy and Braak staging; and between hippocampal atrophy and baseline CSF levels of P-181 tau. Our results could have implications for halting the progression of dementia regardless of the etiology being related to AD or vascular pathology. The choice of combination of A.H.T. therapy should also consider the combination which would lead to an optimum benefit in slowing the progression of dementia. Additionally, our results underline a more complex A.D. disease model than previously thought, which opens new treatment options.

Mecamylamine Reverses the Effects of Cytisine on the Oral Self-administration of Ethanol in Rats.	It has been suggested that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs) expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (nAcc) modulate the effects of drug abuse. This research assessed the effects of intra-accumbal administration of the nAchR antagonist (mecamylamine) and agonist (cytisine) on the operant oral self-administration of ethanol (EtOH) in rats. Male Wistar rats were water-deprived for 24 h and then trained to lever-press for EtOH reinforcement on a fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) schedule for three sessions. After that, the number of responses in the FR schedule increased to 3 until the response rate remained stable at 80%. After this training, the rats received an intra-accumbal injection of the nAchR antagonist, mecamylamine (0.0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μg), then nAchR agonist, cytisine (0.0, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 μg) or the combination of mecamylamine (0.0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μg) and cytisine (3.2 μg) before being provided access to EtOH on a FR3 schedule. The data showed that intra-accumbal administration of mecamylamine reduced operant oral self-administration of EtOH, whereas cytisine increased operant oral self-administration of EtOH. This effect was reversed by mecamylamine. These findings suggest that nAchRs in the nAcc may modulate the operant oral self-administration of EtOH in rats.

Pure LATE-NC: Frequency, clinical impact, and the importance of considering APOE genotype when assessing this and other subtypes of non-Alzheimer's pathologies.	Pure limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic changes (pure LATE-NC) is a term used to describe brains with LATE-NC but lacking intermediate or severe levels of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). Focusing on pure LATE-NC, we analyzed data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Neuropathology Data Set, comprising clinical and pathological information aggregated from 32 NIH-funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs). After excluding subjects dying with unusual conditions, n = 1,926 autopsied subjects were included in the analyses. For > 90% of these participants, apolipoprotein E (APOE) allele status was known; 46.5% had at least one APOE 4 allele. In most human populations, only 15-25% of people are APOE ε4 carriers. ADRCs with higher documented AD risk allele (APOE or BIN1) rates had fewer participants lacking ADNC, and correspondingly low rates of pure LATE-NC. Among APOE ε4 non-carries, 5.3% had pure LATE-NC, 37.0% had pure ADNC, and 3.6% had pure neocortical Lewy body pathology. In terms of clinical impact, participants with pure LATE-NC tended to die after having received a diagnosis of dementia: 56% died with dementia among APOE ε4 non-carrier participants, comparable to 61% with pure ADNC. LATE-NC was associated with increased Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) scores, i.e. worsened global cognitive impairments, in participants with no/low ADNC and no neocortical Lewy body pathology (p = 0.0023). Among pure LATE-NC cases, there was a trend for higher LATE-NC stages to be associated with worse CDR-SOB scores (p = 0.026 for linear trend of LATE-NC stages). Pure LATE-NC was not associated with clinical features of disinhibition or primary progressive aphasia. In summary, LATE-NC with no or low levels of ADNC was less frequent than pure ADNC but was not rare, particularly among individuals who lacked the APOE 4 allele, and in study cohorts with APOE 4 frequencies similar to those in most human populations.

Targeting glioblastoma tumor hyaluronan to enhance therapeutic interventions that regulate metabolic cell properties.	Despite extensive advances in cancer research, glioblastoma (GBM) still remains a very locally invasive and thus challenging tumor to treat, with a poor median survival. Tumor cells remodel their microenvironment and utilize extracellular matrix to promote invasion and therapeutic resistance. We aim here to determine how GBM cells exploit hyaluronan (HA) to maintain proliferation using ligand-receptor dependent and ligand-receptor independent signaling. We use tissue engineering approaches to recreate the three-dimensional tumor microenvironment in vitro, then analyze shifts in metabolism, hyaluronan secretion, HA molecular weight distribution, as well as hyaluronan synthetic enzymes (HAS) and hyaluronidases (HYAL) activity in an array of patient derived xenograft GBM cells. We reveal that endogenous HA plays a role in mitochondrial respiration and cell proliferation in a tumor subtype dependent manner. We propose a tumor specific combination treatment of HYAL and HAS inhibitors to disrupt the HA stabilizing role in GBM cells. Taken together, these data shed light on the dual metabolic and ligand - dependent signaling roles of hyaluronan in glioblastoma.	brain cancer; engineered disease models; glioblastoma; hyaluronan metabolism; hydrogel; tumor microenvironment

Beyond the trained eye: An objective method to predict game sense in team sports.	Talent identification in sports requires a prediction of how athletes will perform in the future based on a sample of their behaviors. Perceptual cognitive-skills or 'game sense' in sports jargon is important for performance, yet sport organizations lack objective and validated measures to predict it. This study aimed to establish the degree to which subjective evaluations of athletes' in-match perceptual-cognitive skills could be predicted by their performance on objective perceptual-cognitive tests. The perceptual-cognitive skills of 40 highly-trained ice-hockey players were assessed by their coaches and the results were compared with the athletes' performance on four laboratory perceptual-cognitive tasks (neuropsychological battery, multiple-object tracking, temporal occlusion, virtual reality). Athletes were also assessed by scouts throughout a hockey season and during small-sided games. Scout judgments best predicted coach rankings, with measures from small-sided games, neuropsychological battery, virtual reality and temporal occlusion improving prediction. Results suggest that adding perceptual-cognitive testing could help scouts better measure athletes during talent identification.

Machine learning center-specific models show improved IVF live birth predictions over US national registry-based model.	Expanding in vitro fertilization (IVF) access requires improved patient counseling and affordability via cost-success transparency. Clinicians ask how two types of live birth prediction (LBP) models perform: machine learning, center-specific (MLCS) models and the multicenter, US national registry-based model produced by Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART). In a retrospective model validation study, we tested whether MLCS performs better than SART using 4635 patients' first-IVF cycle data from 6 centers. MLCS significantly improved minimization of false positives and negatives overall (precision recall area-under-the-curve) and at the 50% LBP threshold (F1 score) compared to SART (p < 0.05). To contextualize, MLCS more appropriately assigned 23% and 11% of all patients to LBP ≥ 50% and LBP ≥ 75% whereas SART gave lower LBPs. Here, we show MLCS improves model metrics relevant for clinical utility - personalizing prognostic counseling and cost-success transparency - and is externally validated. We recommend evaluating MLCS in a larger sample of fertility centers.

Reduction of High Emotional Eating via Increased Physical Activity: Assessing a Path Informed by Multiple Behavioral Theories Within Community-Based Obesity Interventions.	Emotional eating (EE; eating in response to negative emotions) is a considerable problem in adults with obesity. Recent meta-analyses of behavioral treatments for those with elevated body mass index (BMI) have demonstrated inconsistent, but generally minimal, effects for dealing with EE. This might largely be due to inappropriate sampling, cross-sectional research designs, and a lack of understanding of theory-driven psychosocial mechanisms of EE change. This study aimed to inform mental health, medical, and health behavior-change professionals on methods to address EE within obesity treatments. Within the present field-based research, women with high EE participated in 6-month community-based obesity treatments emphasizing either weight-management education + attention on EE (n = 34), self-regulatory skills-no attention on EE (n = 43), or self-regulatory skills + attention on EE (n = 42). Each condition incorporated physical activity for its mood-change potentials. Significant improvements in physical activity, mood, eating-related self-regulation and self-efficacy, EE, and weight were found in all groups, with greater advances occurring in the self-regulation vs. educationally focused conditions. Incorporating aggregated data, significant theory- and previous research-derived paths from changes in physical activity → mood → self-regulation → self-efficacy → EE change over 6 months, and over 12 months, were identified. Reductions in EE over 6 and 12 months predicted weight loss over 6, 12, and 24 months. Findings supported tenets of social cognitive theory, self-regulation theory, the mood-behavior model, and self-efficacy theory, and informed future behavioral obesity treatments on evidence-driven methods to better-address EE within scalable settings.

Investigation of Two Outbreaks of Hepatitis A Virus Infections Linked to Fresh and Frozen Strawberries Imported from Mexico - 2022-2023.	Foodborne hepatitis A illnesses and outbreaks have been associated with consumption of ready-to-eat foods contaminated with the feces of person(s) shedding hepatitis A virus (HAV). Outbreaks have been linked to fresh and frozen produce imported from countries where HAV is endemic, hygiene and sanitation are inadequate, or food safety standards are lacking or unenforced. In 2022 and 2023, federal, state, and international partners investigated two multijurisdictional outbreaks of infections involving the same HAV genotype IA strain linked to fresh and frozen organic strawberries sourced from a single grower in Baja California, Mexico. These resulted in 39 reported cases in the U.S. and Canada, 21 hospitalizations, and no reported deaths. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and U.S. state partners conducted traceback investigations for fresh strawberries in 2022, while FDA and U.S. state partners traced back frozen strawberries in 2023. Based on the traceback investigations, implicated strawberries were harvested during the 2022 growing season and sold to fresh and frozen berry markets. During a farm inspection in Mexico in 2023, gaps were observed in agricultural practices that could have contributed to contamination of strawberries with HAV. FDA did not detect HAV in the two frozen strawberry samples linked to the recalled lots or environmental water samples collected at the implicated grower in 2023; no samples were collected during the 2022 investigation. Indicator organisms associated with human fecal contamination (male-specific coliphage and crAssphge) were detected in environmental water. Challenges in these investigations included limited recall of food exposures, exposures associated with multiple purchase dates, commingling of strawberries within the frozen market supply chains, and complexities with communicating these outbreak investigations to the public.

Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the AS01	Duration of protection after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety over three RSV seasons of the AS01 In this randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (AReSVi-006), participants aged 60 years or older in 275 centres (ie, GP practices and clinical research sites) across 17 countries in Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe, and North America were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive RSVPreF3 OA or placebo before RSV season one. RSVPreF3 OA recipients were re-randomly assigned (1:1) before RSV season two to receive a second RSVPreF3 OA dose (RSV revaccination group) or placebo (RSV single-dose group). Recipients of placebo before RSV season one also received placebo before season two (placebo group). The primary objective (efficacy against first occurrence of RSV-LRTD over one RSV season) was reported previously. Confirmatory secondary objectives were to demonstrate efficacy over three RSV seasons of a single RSVPreF3 OA dose and of a first dose followed by revaccination 1 year later, against RSV-LRTD, overall and by RSV subtype (success criteria: lower limits of two-sided CIs around efficacy estimates >20% [RSV-LRTD] and >0% [RSV-LRTD by RSV subtype]). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04886596, and is complete. Participants were enrolled between May 25, 2021, and Jan 31, 2022. Efficacy analyses included 12 468 RSVPreF3 OA recipients and 12 498 placebo recipients. Cumulative efficacy over three seasons of one RSVPreF3 OA dose was 62·9% (97·5% CI 46·7-74·8) against RSV-LRTD, 69·8% (42·2-85·7) against RSV A-related LRTD, and 58·6% (35·9-74·1) against RSV B-related LRTD (median follow-up from day 15 post-dose one 30·6 months [IQR 26·2-32·0]). Efficacy was observed over three seasons among participants aged 60-69 years, participants aged 70-79 years, pre-frail participants (ie, those with a walking speed of 0·4-0·99 m/s in a gait speed test), and participants with pre-existing conditions that increase the RSV-LRTD risk. Efficacy against RSV-LRTD decreased over time. A first RSVPreF3 OA dose followed by revaccination 1 year later had an efficacy that was within the same range as that of one dose. RSVPreF3 OA showed a clinically acceptable safety profile. Between dose one and trial end, eight (<1%) participants in the RSV single-dose group, 12 (<1%) in the RSV revaccination group, and 12 (<1%) in the placebo group had a serious adverse event considered to be related to the trial intervention by the investigator. Five deaths were assessed as related to the trial intervention by the investigator: three in the vaccine groups (cardiopulmonary failure, cardiac arrest, and left ventricular failure) and two in the placebo group (death of unknown cause and pulmonary embolism). A single RSVPreF3 OA dose was efficacious against RSV-LRTD over three RSV seasons in people aged 60 years or older, despite a decrease in efficacy over time. Further research is needed to establish the optimal revaccination strategy. These results support the favourable benefit-risk profile of RSVPreF3 OA to help protect against RSV-LRTD for at least three RSV seasons. GSK.

Mechanism of Injury and Clinical Recovery Outcomes Following Pediatric Concussion.	Children with concussion are injured through a variety of mechanisms, but the relationship between mechanism of injury (MOI) and recovery outcomes is unclear due to small sample sizes and varied methodological designs. Our objective was to examine the association of MOI and clinical recovery in youth with concussion using a large dataset collated from a single, multisite study. We hypothesized that sport-related concussion would be related to better clinical presentation and faster recovery trajectories compared to other mechanisms of concussion. This study was a secondary analysis of data collected during the Predicting and Preventing Postconcussive Problems in Pediatrics study.

Predictable and Unpredictable Threat Immune Enhancement.	Acute social stress has been associated with increased immune system activation. However, less is known about whether non-social acute stressors also impact the immune response. In addition, most studies examine stressors that contain multiple characteristics (e.g., social, unpredictable) that could contribute to an increased immune response, but few studies have attempted to disentangle these factors. Finally, few studies have examined whether simultaneous changes in affect are associated with changes in the immune response. The present study used a between-subjects design to examine immune system activation, via changes in salivary cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-1β, and tumour necrosis factor-α, in response to predictable and unpredictable electric shock. A multimodal assessment of changes in defencive motivation (startle reflex), attention (event-related potential probe N100, P300), and self-reported affect were evaluated to confirm the effectiveness of the threat manipulation. As expected, results indicated that the threat manipulation enhanced defencive motivation, attention, and self-reported affect. Across all participants, both predictable and unpredictable threat increased IL-8 but decreased IL-6. Greater changes in self-reported negative affect were associated with greater increases in the overall immune response. The present study suggests that acute non-social stress enhances immune system activation, particularly in those who experience greater changes in negative affect.

The effect of a healthy lifestyle on reducing the utilisation of healthcare professionals and prescription medications among stroke survivors: a longitudinal investigation using linked administrative data.	The aim of the study was to examine whether a healthy lifestyle was associated with reduced utilisation of healthcare professionals and/or prescription medications for stroke survivors. The study utilised data obtained from the 45 and Up Study, linked to the Medicare claims and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data. The outcome variables were the number of times a person received care from a range of healthcare professions and the number of different prescription medications used by participants. The risk factors were smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and supplement use. Generalised Estimating Equation models were employed to assess the longitudinal association between an outcome variable and risk factors. Stroke survivors who engaged in moderate-to-high levels of physical activity were significantly less likely to receive care from a general practitioner, a nurse, and an allied health professional, as well as to take blood-thinning medications. Stroke survivors who smoked were more likely to receive care from a specialist doctor. Moreover, stroke survivors who consumed supplements were more likely to receive care from an allied health professional. The findings carry substantial implications for stroke rehabilitation and secondary prevention, highlighting the positive effects of moderate-to-high physical activity and the associated risks of smoking. Engaging in moderate-to-high levels of physical activity (≥150 minutes/week) can significantly alleviate the burden on healthcare professionals and reduce treatment demands among those with stroke.Engaging in moderate-to-high physical activity can significantly decrease the necessity for blood-thinning medications in stroke survivors.Abstaining from smoking may positively impact stroke rehabilitation.

Diabetes, lowered mental health functioning and the use of conventional and complementary medicine: results from a secondary analysis of the complementary medicine use, health literacy and disclosure (CAMUHLD) study.	Diabetes Mellitus is often a long-term health condition that continues to raise concerns regarding the burden upon an individual's mental health, due to the commitment required for day-to-day self-care. People living with diabetes frequently use complementary medicine as part of their diabetes self-care to manage their mental health and this raises a number of significant risk management issues. Unfortunately, no research has explored the influence of lowered mental health functioning upon both the conventional and complementary medicine health service use amongst people living with diabetes. An examination of the conventional and complementary medicine health service use amongst men and women living with diabetes and normative or lowered mental health functioning, was undertaken by completing a secondary analysis of the Complementary Medicine Use, Health Literacy and Disclosure study. Of the 176 participants reporting a diabetes diagnosis, 74% reported lowered mental health functioning, compared to 60% without a diabetes diagnosis. Compared to people living with diabetes and normative mental health functioning, those with lowered mental health functioning were 9 times more likely to consult with a Western herbalist (OR = 9.17, 95% CI: 1.097-76.84), twice as likely to use vitamins or minerals (OR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.061-5.151), and 5 times more likely to engage in relaxation or meditation practice (OR = 5.10, 95% CI: 1.362-19.129). People living with diabetes who have lowered mental health functioning appear even more likely to use complementary medicine than conventional medicine, than those with normative mental health functioning. This reinforces the need to resolve clinical governance issues associated with complementary medicine use, especially what role complementary medicine practitioners can fulfil as part of coordinated diabetes care teams, to support patient health and well-being.

Targeting respiratory virus-induced reactive oxygen species in airways diseases.	The immune response to virus infection in the respiratory tract must be carefully balanced to achieve pathogen clearance without excessive immunopathology. For chronic respiratory diseases where there is ongoing inflammation, such as in asthma and COPD, airway immune balance is perturbed, and viral infection frequently worsens (exacerbates) these conditions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical to the induction and propagation of inflammation, and when appropriately regulated, ROS are vital cell signalling molecules and contribute to innate immunity. However, extended periods of high ROS concentration can cause excessive cellular damage that dysregulates antiviral immunity and promotes inflammation. Traditional antioxidant therapeutics have had limited success treating inflammatory diseases such as viral exacerbations of asthma or COPD, owing to nonspecific pharmacology and poorly understood pharmacokinetic properties. These drawbacks could be addressed with novel drug delivery technologies and pharmacological agents. This review summarises current research on ROS imbalances during virus infection, discusses the commercially available mitochondrial antioxidant drugs that have progressed to clinical trial and assesses novel drug delivery approaches for antioxidant delivery to the airways. Additionally, it provides a perspective on future research into pharmacological targeting of ROS for the treatment of respiratory virus infection and disease.

Why Do Primary Anatomic Total Shoulder Arthroplasties Fail Today? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasties (aTSA) are increasingly used to treat glenohumeral osteoarthritis, offering favorable long-term outcomes. Despite these successes, contemporary failure rates remain significant, warranting a comprehensive analysis of the causes of primary aTSA failure to enhance patient selection criteria, refine surgical techniques, and inform improvements in implant design. This PROSPERO-registered systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A literature search was performed on PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and SPORTDiscus, covering publications from 2014 to 2024. Data extraction focused on failure modality, and subgroup analyses were performed for early and late-term follow-up, study type, and metal-backed or all-polyethylene glenoid implants. Proportional meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 44 studies involving 35,168 aTSA procedures and 2,744 failures were included. Implant loosening was the most common failure mode (26.1%, 95% CI [18.9 - 34.9%]), with 21.7% (95% CI [14.4 - 31.3%]) of failures attributed to glenoid loosening. Rotator cuff insufficiency accounted for 17.3% (95% CI [10.9 - 26.4%]) of failures, followed by infection (10.2%, 95% CI [7.6 - 13.4%]) and instability (10.4%, 95% CI [7.0 - 15.1%]). Early-term failures (<5 years) were predominantly due to implant loosening (30.1%, 95% CI [15.9 - 46.3%]), rotator cuff insufficiency (21.6%, 95% CI [9.9 - 40.8%]), and infection (12.6%, 95% CI [10.6 - 15.0%]), whereas late-term failures (>5 years) were most often attributed to implant loosening (52.9%, 95% CI [23.8 - 80.2%]), primarily of the glenoid component (46.6%, 95% CI [25.0 - 69.6%]). Failures in metal-backed glenoid implants were predominantly attributed to implant loosening (all were glenoid loosening) (18.4%, 95% CI [6.3 - 43.1%]), rotator cuff insufficiency (9.2%, 95% CI [2.9 - 25.6%]), and instability (7.0%, 95% CI [1.7 - 24.2%]). Failures in all-polyethylene glenoid implants were predominantly due to rotator cuff insufficiency (39.2%, 95% CI [16.0 - 68.7%]), infection (12.5%, 95% CI [5.7 - 25.2%]), and instability (12.5%, 95% CI [5.7 - 25.2%]). This study identified implant loosening (26.1%), particularly of the glenoid component, as the most common cause of contemporary aTSA failure, followed by rotator cuff insufficiency (17.3%), instability (10.4%), and infection (10.2%). These findings underscore the multifactorial etiology of aTSA failures and emphasize areas for improvement within aTSA survivorship.

Design of a fractional-order environmental toxin-plankton system in aquatic ecosystems: A novel machine predictive expedition with nonlinear autoregressive neuroarchitectures.	Artificial intelligence has transformed both plankton dynamics and hazardous material management under toxic environments by enhanced hazard prediction in detecting how toxins affect plankton population and potentially uncovering greater depth of ecological insights. In proposed study, nonlinear autoregressive exogenous neural network coupled with Levenberg-Marquardt is efficaciously selected to model fractional order toxin plankton (FOTP) system asserting the phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics in aquatic environment under influence of environmental toxins. The fractional differential ecological TP system incorporates density population of phytoplankton, zooplankton and environmental toxins exacted by fractional Adams multistep predictor-corrector method across arbitrary fractional order cases varying intrinsic growth rates of phytoplankton and zooplankton, zooplankton carrying capacity, phytoplankton toxin release, fish predation parameters (half-saturation constant and maximum rate), environmental toxin depletion, and dynamic phytoplankton carrying capacity. Synthetic datasets were split into training, testing, and validation subsets to model the FOTP system using an intelligent neurocomputing paradigm. The proficiency of the selected neural networks is demonstrated by performance metrics-MSE convergence, time-series fitness patterns, regression reports, error histograms and correlation analyses-while comparative analysis with numerical outcomes and absolute error plots underscores the robustness and stability of the neurocomputing architecture.

Abdominal cancer pain admission in emergency department vs. oncology emergency department.	To investigate the rates of hospitalization, opioid prescription, supportive care, hospice referral, and 30-day all-cause mortality in patients with metastatic cancer and abdominal pain admitted to either the Emergency Department (ED) or the Oncology ED. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with metastatic cancer and abdominal pain admitted to the ED or Oncology ED at a tertiary medical center between June 2020 and May 2022. The MDClone ADAMS Platform, a healthcare data analytics environment, was used for data collection. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) based on propensity scoring was used to balance and compare characteristics of patient groups admitted to both ED settings. Weighted multivariable logistic regression found that metastatic cancer patients with abdominal pain complaints visiting the Oncology ED were 66% less likely to be admitted to the hospital (OR 0.34, 95% CI [0.16, 0.72], p-value = 0.005), and more likely to receive a supportive care consultation (OR 4.67, 95% CI [1.45, 15.05], p-value = 0.010), compared with the ED. Our study found that an Oncology ED, due to its expertise and immediate access to supportive care services due to their physical location within the same facility, enables prompt intervention for symptom management and psychosocial support, besides providing further oncology outpatient clinics follow-up for patients with metastatic cancer. We believe that a developed oncology emergency care with specialized staff has the potential to reduce hospitalization rates.

Guideline-concordant treatment among adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Individuals diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) between 15-39yo (AYA: adolescents and young adults) face poor survival and unique challenges. We evaluated facility-level factors and guideline-concordant care (GCC) among AYAs with ALL at National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) practices. We assembled a retrospective cohort of 15-39yo AYAs with ALL treated at participating NCORPs between 2012-2016. NCORPs abstracted patient data and completed facility-level questionnaires for each clinical facility (CF: study-defined criteria). The central review committee adjudicated whether treatment was concordant with AYA-specific National Comprehensive Cancer Network ALL guidelines (ie, pediatric-inspired therapy or clinical trial). GCC was described by age, facility model (adult/internal medicine [adult/IM], pediatric, mixed [pediatric services within a general hospital]), and average annual AYA ALL volume. Generalized linear mixed effects models estimated the odds of GCC. AYAs receiving GCC were younger (n = 196, median = 19.5y) than those who did not (n = 31, median = 32.1y). GCC was observed in many 22-39yo (68.8%), and nearly universal in 15-21 y. In multivariable analyses, AYAs at adult/IM CFs had lower odds of GCC (OR = 0.02, 95% CI, 0.0-0.18); there was no statistically significant association between annual AYA ALL volume and receiving GCC. GCC was observed more often in adult/IM and/or mixed CFs with communication between adult/pediatric counterparts, AYA ALL Clinical Pathways, and/or AYA-specific meetings. GCC among AYAs with ALL (specifically pediatric-inspired therapy) at NCORPs is associated with facility model (adult/IM), but not AYA ALL volume. Strategies to improve GCC could include facilitating communication and clinical pathways at adult/IM CFs treating AYA ALL.

Association Between Timing of Antibiotics and Deep Surgical Site Infection in Gustilo-Anderson Type III Open Tibia Fractures.	To determine the association between the timing of antibiotic delivery in the emergency department (ED) and deep surgical site infection in Gustilo-Anderson (GA) type III open tibia fractures. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Single Level I Trauma Center. Patients aged ≥18 years with a Gustilo-Anderson (GA) type III open tibia fracture (OTA/AO 41, 42, or 43) from 2016 to 2021 were included. The outcome was deep surgical site infection requiring irrigation and debridement. The effect of time of delivery of antibiotics was compared in 3 analyses: as a continuous variable, before vs after 60 minutes, and before vs after 180 minutes. The study analysis accounted for known confounders for infection, including Injury Severity Score (ISS), GA classification, and wound contamination. The study population included 191 patients with a mean age of 44 years (SD: 17) and 153 males. The median time from arrival to the first antibiotic was 44 minutes (IQR: 21-147). The majority of patients (99.0%) received cephazolin as their initial antibiotic. The overall 90-day risk of deep surgical site infection requiring irrigation and debridement was 10.5%. The timing of antibiotic administration as a continuous variable was not associated with infection (aOR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00, P = 0.39). Similarly, time to antibiotic administration was not associated with infection at thresholds of 1 hour (aOR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.39-2.68, P = 0.96) or 3 hours (aOR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.35-3.37, P = 0.89) in separate models. Early antibiotic administration was not associated with a reduced risk of deep surgical site infection in GA type III tibia fractures. These results suggest that the acute timing of antibiotics may not be as impactful to patients' risk of infection as once considered. Therapeutic, Level III.

Bacteria can resist antibiotics and toxic substances within demanding ecological settings, such as low oxygen, extreme acid, and during nutrient starvation. MdtEF, a proton motive force-driven efflux pump from the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily, is upregulated in these conditions but its molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of Escherichia coli multidrug transporter MdtF within native-lipid nanodiscs, including a single-point mutant with an altered multidrug phenotype and associated substrate-bound form. We reveal that drug binding domain and channel conformational plasticity likely governs promiscuous substrate specificity, analogous to its closely related, constitutively expressed counterpart, AcrB. Whereas we discover distinct transmembrane state transitions within MdtF, which create a more engaged proton relay network, altered drug transport allostery and an acid-responsive increase in efflux efficiency. Physiologically, this provides means of xenobiotic and metabolite disposal within remodelled cell membranes that presage encounters with acid stresses, as endured in the gastrointestinal tract.

Asthma is driven by complex interactions amongst structural airway cells, cells of the immune system, and the environmental. While sputum cell characterization has been instrumental in studying asthma pathogenesis and refining treatment strategies, the nuances of cellular transcriptomes and intercellular communication in asthmatic sputum remain poorly understood. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze cells isolated form the sputum from 16 asthma patients and 8 non-asthmatic controls. Cell identities were established using curated marker genes and SingleR annotation. We compared cell-specific gene expression and communication networks between asthmatic and control groups, correlating findings with distinct pathways that were dysregulated in asthma. 37,565 cellular transcriptomes were captured and analyzed. 15 distinct cell populations were identified, including various macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, along with rare cell types such as mast cells, innate lymphoid cells, bronchial epithelial cells, and eosinophils. Intercellular communication analysis indicated heightened signaling activity in asthma compared to controls, particularly in CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells which exhibited the most significant increases in RNA expression of outgoing signaling molecules. Notably, the ADAM12-SDC4 and CCL22-CCR4 ligand-receptor pathways demonstrated the strongest shifts between asthma and control subjects, particularly between dendritic cells and CD4 lymphocytes. SC RNA seq profiling the asthma cellular transcriptome analysis of sputum highlights both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are significantly amplified in asthma. The elevated expression of ADAM12-SCD4 and CCL22-CC4 point to their critical role in asthma pathogenesis, suggesting potential avenues for targeted therapies and improved management of this chronic condition.

Comorbid Cannabis Use and Mood Disorders Among Adolescents.	Adolescence is a unique developmental period marked by increased exploration and risk-taking, as well as important brain development milestones. Many people who use substances will begin using during adolescence, and cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance among adolescents. For adolescents with mood disorders, cannabis use (and, by extension, cannabis use disorder) is even more likely, and the associated consequences are even more significant. In this review, we explore the assessment of cannabis use disorder among adolescents, the impact of cannabis use on mood symptoms, level-of-care recommendations for adolescents with comorbid cannabis use and mood disorders, and effective treatment options.

Stimuli-Responsive Prodrug Linkers that Simultaneously Release Cargo and Neutralize in situ Generated (Aza)Quinone Methides.	Self-immolative linkers that use p-amino/hydroxy-benzyloxycarbonyl (PABC/PHBC) spacers are essential to the mechanism of many prodrugs. However, a highly reactive (aza)quinone methide is generated as a potential toxic byproduct. To remove the methide as it forms, we synthesized a series of novel tripartite prodrugs, comprising different triggers (nitro, amide, azide, boronate) and a PABC/PHBC-type self-immolative spacer with an integrated nucleophile (amine). Upon reductive, hydrolytic or oxidative trigger activation, the release of the cargo is facilitated via a 1,6-elimination that generates a reactive (aza)quinone methide. With the built-in nucleophile, the (aza)quinone methide is rapidly self-quenched to generate tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). One of the selected THIQs does not exhibit an anti-proliferative effect on the A431 mammalian tumor cell line. The new prodrug strategy has broad scope, enabling the use of a trigger that matches the targeted stimulus, while allowing for a diverse range of drug/cargo attachment. This proof-of-concept study adds a new linker strategy that quenches the electrophilic (aza)quinone methide generated in many self-immolative linker systems and could find applications in prodrug and antibody-drug conjugate strategies, or as a linker for probes in chemical biology.

Learnings from providing integrated health, housing and wider care for people rough sleeping during the COVID- 19 pandemic: a national qualitative study of the 'Everyone In' policy initiative.	The 'Everyone In' national policy initiative launched in England during the COVID- 19 pandemic provided accommodation and health and care support to people who were (or at risk of) sleeping rough. This study aims to understand what worked well and less well in implementing 'Everyone In' for improving physical and mental health outcomes for people experiencing homelessness. Between January and October 2023, in-depth interviews/focus groups were conducted across England with those involved in the delivery/implementation of 'Everyone In' and those accommodated. Framework analysis and case study analysis were used for a contextual understanding of the implementation of the policy initiative. Twenty-five people accommodated through 'Everyone In' (28-58 years; 88% males) and 43 service providers (25-62 years; 40% males) were interviewed. Flexibility in funding and resources, 'joining up' services/support, and innovative responsiveness in services across health, care, and housing systems were key positive features of the initiative. In the long term, 'Everyone In' has provided positive learnings for delivering holistic and integrated health and social care. It has also highlighted the importance of accommodating psychosocial needs and addressing the complexities of alcohol and substance use in all homelessness strategies. Pathways to care for people experiencing homelessness need to be flexible and responsive. Complexities such as substance use need to be approached with compassion while addressing the role of wider determinants in such health behaviours. Innovative approaches and joined-up work improve delivery of interventions and integrated care can reduce barriers to access to support.

Evaluation of the Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Novel Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 4 Inhibitors in Microglia.	Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) is a key lipid binding protein expressed in microglia, which has been demonstrated to play a critical role in microglial-mediated neuroinflammation, a component of many neurodegenerative diseases. Compounds able to inhibit the function of FABP4 have shown promise in reducing microglial-mediated neuroinflammation, however, their physicochemical properties would prevent their ability to be easily formulated and traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in order to access microglial FABP4. To this end, this study assessed the ability of a series of FABP4 inhibitors, with more desirable physicochemical properties, to attenuate microglial inflammation in an in vitro setting. Four inhibitors with varying affinity to FABP4, as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (MFP-0011462, MFP-0012314, MFP-0012318, and MFP-0012328), were assessed for their ability to induce toxicity and attenuate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated BV-2 microglia. All FABP4 inhibitors were determined to be soluble in the aqueous buffers at the highest concentration used in the assays (100 µM). Isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrated that the compounds had varying affinities for FABP4 (K	Fatty acid-binding protein 4; Microglia; Neuroinflammation; Reactive oxygen species; Tumour necrosis factor alpha

Pain management training for people with persistent pain and their informal carers (JOINT SUPPORT): multicentre randomised controlled feasibility trial with embedded qualitative study in English musculoskeletal services.	To assess the feasibility of conducting a pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a pain management training intervention to support people with persistent musculoskeletal pain and their informal carers. Two-arm, multicentre, pragmatic, open, feasibility RCT with embedded qualitative study. National Health Service (NHS) providers in four English hospitals. Adults receiving NHS care for persistent musculoskeletal pain and their informal carers. Control: usual NHS care. usual NHS care plus a carer-patient pain management training intervention (JOINT SUPPORT), comprising five, 1-hour, group-based sessions for patients and carers, delivered by trained physiotherapists or occupational therapists. Content included understanding pain, pacing, graded activity, fear avoidance, goal-setting, understanding the benefits of physical activity and medication management. This was re-enforced with a workbook. After the group-based sessions, patients and carers were supported through three telephone sessions. Central randomisation was computer-generated (2:1 Experimental:Control), stratified by hospital and patient-participant age (≤65 years). There was no blinding. Data collected at baseline and 3 months post-randomisation included screening logs, intervention logs, fidelity checklists and clinical outcomes on quality of life, physical and emotional outcomes, adverse events and resource use. Interviews with 14 patient-carer participants and six health professionals who delivered the intervention. A total of 76 participants (38 patients; 38 carers) were enrolled. Sixty per cent (312/480) of patients screened were eligible with 12% consenting to be randomised (38/312). Fifty-four per cent (13/24) of the experimental group reached minimal compliance with the JOINT SUPPORT intervention. There was no evidence of treatment contamination. For patient-participant outcomes, within-group differences from baseline to 3 months favoured the control group when assessed by EQ-5D and Generalised Self-Efficacy total score, but favoured the intervention group when assessed by numerical rating scale pain, fatigue and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scaletotal score. Qualitative data demonstrated the acceptability of the trial design and JOINT SUPPORT intervention with modifications to improve trial processes. The JOINT SUPPORT intervention was acceptable to patient-carer dyads and health professionals. Modifications to trial design, particularly enhanced recruitment strategies, are required.

Rurality and Area Deprivation and Outcomes After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.	Large regional variations in outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) exist. To assess whether neighborhood rurality or economic deprivation where an OHCA occurred is associated with variation in emergency medical services (EMS) outcomes after OHCA. This cohort study used data collated by ESO Inc on US adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with nontraumatic OHCA receiving chest compressions or defibrillation from EMS between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023. Rurality was assessed using Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes. Deprivation was assessed using the Area Deprivation Index. Both were derived from US Census data and grouped by EMS agency. Outcomes were restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at emergency department (ED) arrival, survival to hospital discharge, and favorable discharge destination. Discharge outcomes were only available for patients transported to hospitals using health data exchange. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for correlated data. A total of 162 289 patients with OHCA had resuscitation attempted (median [IQR] age, 66 [53-76] years; 62.3% male). Overall, 28.1% of these patients lived in rural or suburban locations, 12.3% lived in areas with high deprivation, 18.7% had a first rhythm of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation or shockable by automated external defibrillator rhythm, and 27.6% received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The mean (SD) EMS response time was 8.7 (5.6) minutes. Upon arrival at the ED, 23.7% of patients had ROSC. Compared with OHCAs in urban areas with low deprivation, those in rural areas with high deprivation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72-0.91), moderate deprivation (AOR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70-0.81), or low deprivation (AOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.88) had lower odds of ROSC at ED arrival. Among patients transported to hospitals using health data exchange, OHCAs in urban areas with high or moderate deprivation had lower odds of survival (AOR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.68-0.90] and 0.82 [95% CI, 0.75-0.89], respectively) and favorable discharge destination (AOR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.53-0.79] and 0.77 [95% CI, 0.69-0.87], respectively). In this cohort study, OHCAs in rural areas of all levels of economic deprivation were associated with less ROSC at ED arrival vs urban areas with low deprivation, and OHCAs in urban areas with high or moderate deprivation are associated with less survival and less favorable discharge destination, suggesting worse neurologic outcomes. Care improvements alone may not reduce geographic differences in outcomes after OHCA.

Key Insights From a Decade of Breast Augmentation: Our 5 Critical Decisions in Breast Implant Selection.	Breast augmentation continues to rank among the most commonly performed procedures. A crucial factor in achieving successful outcomes lies in a methodical implant-selection system, a principle underscored by Tebbetts and Adams in their TEPID and High Five systems. We have revisited several factors during years of experience. Thorough preoperative consultations play a pivotal role, involving discussions on the patient's motivation for breast augmentation and their medical history. Subsequently, medical photographs are taken, and 5 critical breast measurements are recorded: sternal notch-nipple distance, base width of the breast, soft-tissue coverage of the implant, optimal implant selection based on volume and dimensions, and calculation of the neo-inframammary fold using the Pythagorean theorem. Our system goes beyond traditional approaches by offering patients the chance to preview the postoperative result through both bra sizers and 3-dimensional simulation. Shared decision-making is another integral aspect of our methodology, providing patients with a voice in the medical decision-making process. During the period from 2009 to 2019, the senior author conducted primary breast augmentations on 716 patients, with follow-ups extending up to 3 years. Notably, 1.5% (11 patients) required reoperation, and only 0.03% (2 patients) underwent reoperation specifically for implant size exchange. Our system's strength lies in its reliance on straightforward tissue-based measurements and a commitment to incorporating patient preferences through interactive decision-making. We aim to contribute to the professional development of fellow plastic surgeons and residents by sharing our 5 critical decisions, confident in their potential value for enhancing their practice.

Profile of the PLAY spaces & environments for children's physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep (PLAYCE) cohort study, Western Australia.	Childhood is a critical period for the development of movement behaviours such as physical activity, sleep and sedentary behaviour. The PLAYCE Cohort was established to investigate how movement behaviours change over early to middle childhood, across key behaviour settings and relationships with health and development. An overview of the PLAYCE cohort, summary of key findings to date, and future research opportunities are presented. Children were recruited at 2-5 years of age (preschool; Wave 1) via early childhood education and care (ECEC) services and were followed up in junior primary school (5-7 years; Wave 2) at 8-10 years (Wave 3) and again at 11-13 years (Wave 4; in progress). Children's movement behaviours were measured via parent-report and accelerometry. Social-emotional development, motor development, weight status, diet, and child and family socio-demographics were parent-reported. Physical environmental features of children's key behaviour settings (home, neighbourhood, ECEC and school) were collected using geo-spatial and audit data. At wave 1 (2-5 years), only 8% of children met all three recommendations of the Australian 24-hour Movement Guidelines for the Early Years. Meeting all recommendations (8%) was positively associated with boys social-emotional development. Physical environment features of the home yard (size, play equipment, natural features) were positively associated with preschool children's physical activity. Tree canopy and more portable play equipment in ECEC outdoor areas was also positively associated with children's outdoor time and physical activity. Wave 4 (11-13 years) data collection will be completed in early 2026. Traditional longitudinal and compositional data analysis of the PLAYCE cohort will be undertaken. Four waves of data will provide detailed patterns of movement behaviours and their effect on child health and development as well as the environmental influences on children's movement behaviours across early to middle childhood. The findings can be used to inform national and international 24-Hour Movement Guidelines and behaviour setting-specific as well as population-level interventions to benefit child health and wellbeing across early to middle childhood.

Balancing Efficiency and Equity in Population-Wide CKD Screening.	In the era of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, population-wide screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD) may provide good value, yet implications across racial and ethnic groups are unknown. To evaluate the health outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of population-wide CKD screening for 4 racial and ethnic groups. In this cost-effectiveness analysis, a decision-analytic Markov model was separately calibrated to simulate CKD progression among simulated cohorts of US Hispanic adults, non-Hispanic Black adults, non-Hispanic White adults, and adults who belong to additional racial and ethnic groups (ie, Asian and multiracial individuals and those self-reporting other race and ethnicity). Effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors was derived from the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease trial. Mortality, quality-of-life weights, and cost estimates were obtained from published cohort studies, randomized clinical trials, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data. Analyses were conducted from January 1, 2023, to November 6, 2024. One-time or periodic (every 10 or 5 years) screening for albuminuria, initiated between age 35 and 75 years, with and without addition of SGLT2 inhibitors to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker therapy for CKD. Lifetime cumulative incidence of kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT); discounted life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), lifetime health care costs (in 2024 US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Under the status quo, non-Hispanic Black adults aged 35 years had the highest lifetime incidence of kidney failure requiring KRT (6.2% [95% UI, 2.8%-10.6%]) compared with Hispanic adults (3.6% [95% UI, 1.1%-6.7%]), non-Hispanic White adults (2.3% [95% UI, 0.4%-5.2%]), and adults from additional racial and ethnic groups (3.3% [95% UI, 1.2%-6.5%]). Screening every 5 years from ages 55 to 75 years combined with SGLT2 inhibitors reduced incidence of KRT and increased LYs across all racial and ethnic groups, with the largest average changes observed for non-Hispanic Black adults (0.8-percentage point decrease and 0.19-year increase). Every 5-year screening from age 55 to 75 years cost $99 100/QALY gained for the overall population and less than $150 000/QALY gained across racial and ethnic groups, with the lowest cost observed for non-Hispanic Black adults ($73 400/QALY gained). Screening starting at age 35 years was only cost-effective for non-Hispanic Black adults ($115 000/QALY gained). In this cost-effectiveness analysis, population-wide screening for CKD from ages 55 to 75 years was projected to improve population health, was cost-effective, and reduced disparities across 4 racial and ethnic groups. Starting population-wide screening at younger ages was projected to further benefit non-Hispanic Black adults.

Non-celiac Enteropathies.	Non-celiac enteropathies (NCE) can be due to a variety of causes. The workup for NCE includes history, physical, laboratory and histology review and can be difficult. Enteropathies can result in serious illness due to consequences of malabsorption including severe weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and debilitating diarrhea. Recognition and support of these consequences while investigating underlying etiology is essential. Recent studies in NCEs have focused on improving diagnostic accuracy and predicting long-term outcomes in patients with NCEs. Further, literature has emphasized the importance of histological analysis, with a focus on differentiating between various enteropathies that cause villous atrophy, highlighting the complexity and need for personalized approaches in managing these conditions. Identification of etiologies of NCEs requires review of patients' detailed history, medications, and lab results. Common etiologies include immunodeficiencies, infectious, iatrogenic, and malignant causes. Using a systematic approach can lead to proper diagnosis and tailor treatment choices, benefiting patient outcomes. Supportive nutrition care should be initiated early when applicable to minimize morbidity.	Celiac disease; Malabsorption; Small intestine

Incomplete reperfusion and the presence of distal emboli in predicting clinical outcome after endovascular thrombectomy.	To explore the relationship between final expanded treatment in cerebral infarction (eTICI) score and the presence or absence of distal emboli on final angiography on clinical outcome after endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS). Persistent distal emboli on angiography are commonly noted, yet not all patients with intermediate eTICI scores demonstrate clear angiographic emboli, raising the possibility that these angiographic differences may correlate with distinct mechanisms of 'no-reflow'. Therefore, we sought to better understand the potential clinical impact of such angiographic markers in cases of incomplete reperfusion. We performed an exploratory retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected group of AIS patients who underwent EVT for M1 occlusions using the ASSIST Registry. 71 sites in 11 countries participated in the registry. A total of 650 patients with M1 occlusions were included. We compared 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores based on eTICI score as well as the presence or absence of distal emboli on final angiography. Clinical outcome based only on eTICI score revealed a shift in 90-day mRS, with a significant difference across eTICI scores in predicting 90-day mRS 0-2. In the intermediate eTICI grades 2b67 and 2c, there was a trend towards better 90-day mRS when emboli were present on final angiography than when emboli were absent. However, pairwise comparisons between these levels were non-significant. In patients with final eTICI 2b67 or 2c, those with persistent emboli trended towards better clinical outcomes. With intermediate eTICI reperfusion, identifying the presence or absence of distal emboli on final angiography may be useful in distinguishing patterns of incomplete reperfusion. These findings should be followed by investigations on correlation between angiography and other markers of microcirculatory 'no-reflow'. NCT03845491.

Diagnostic Significance of Serum Ferritin and Hepcidin as Complementary Biomarkers for Prostate Disease: A Prospective Case-Control Study in a Mission Hospital, Ghana.	Currently, available evidence suggests prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is highly sensitive but poorly specific for prostate cancer detection in symptomatic patients and those with lower urinary tract symptoms. Serum ferritin and hepcidin, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancers, may complement the diagnostic value of PSA. This study explored the correlation of serum PSA with ferritin and hepcidin as new and complementary diagnostic biomarkers for prostate disease. This hospital-based case-control study was conducted at Methodist Hospital, Wenchi, with 90 participants. Venous blood sample was taken for complete blood count, PSA, ferritin, and hepcidin measurements using Mindray automated hematology analyzer and ELISA, respectively. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 27, and Serum PSA levels were significantly higher among the Prostate Cancer patients compared to BPE patients [32.1 (18.2-47.6) vs. 18.3 (12.2-0.6), High levels of serum ferritin and hepcidin significantly correlated directly with increased serum total PSA levels and could play a valuable role to complement the noninvasive total PSA to improve diagnostic accuracy.	benign prostatic enlargement; ferritin; hepcidin; prostate cancer; prostate‐specific antigen

Loudness perception deficits during altered and absent auditory feedback in Parkinson's disease.	Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) present with speech difficulties including abnormal speech intensity regulation. It is possible that the neural circuitry in speech may be unique and more complex compared to the other major motor symptoms. The current study aimed to provide a better understanding of the sensorimotor integration and loudness perception deficits in PD using an altered intensity feedback (AIF) paradigm. Twenty-six participants with PD and 26 neurologically healthy control participants completed a magnitude production task (normal loudness, 2× louder, 4× louder, and max loudness) while being presented with AIF and background noise. The task was repeated in complete masking noise and loudness perception ratings were obtained in all conditions (no noise and background noise). Results suggest that unlike previous studies in other sensorimotor domains, individuals with PD display a reduced reliance on auditory sensory feedback such that during a speech magnitude production task, their perception of those productions may rely less on the auditory sensory feedback being received. Loudness perception results in the absence of auditory feedback suggest a modulating effect of sensory feedback on somatosensation or sense of effort in PD.

The purpose of this study was to analyze if Area Deprivation Index (ADI), as a geography-based proxy for socioeconomic status (SES), is associated with differences in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) 2 years after outpatient orthopaedic surgery. Patients undergoing outpatient orthopaedic surgery from June 2015 to November 2018 were administered Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and joint-specific surveys at baseline and 2 years postoperatively. ADI was computed from home address. Tests of association were used to characterize 2-year PROs dependence on ADI. This informed covariate selection for multivariable linear regression examined PRO change over 2 years with ADI in the context of other self-reported socioeconomic covariates. Enrollment was 2117 patients, 1483 (70 %) completed follow-up. Lower SES as measured by home address was associated with lower function and less improvement from baseline at 2 years postoperatively. This trend was most apparent in PROMIS instruments. SES as approximated by ADI is associated with PROs at 2 years after outpatient orthopaedic surgery for a subset of PROs. ADI should be considered for inclusion in statistical models using an SES-sensitive PRO as an outcome, understanding that model performance may also depend on if a single value or change over time is being estimated.

North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children.	Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a disorder recognized for its unique intensity of vomiting attacks and inordinate impact on quality of life. There is considerable symptom overlap with migraine. Due to the lack of evidence-based treatment algorithms, current management strategies vary. These evidence-based guidelines were formulated to replace prior expert consensus recommendations and to assist patients and clinicians in the management of pediatric CVS. Guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts and a patient representative who prioritized questions relevant to medical providers and patients. The guidelines were developed based on systematic reviews with assessment of certainty of the evidence, following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including indirect evidence from pediatric migraine headache literature to strengthen the recommendations in areas with limited evidence. The panel used GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks to formulate recommendations, which were subject to public comment. The panel formulated 16 recommendations on the management of pediatric CVS using nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Recommendations were subdivided into abortive (acute) and prophylactic (preventive) interventions. A strong recommendation was formulated for the use of anti-migraine agents in aborting CVS episodes in patients with a personal or family history of migraine. Conditional recommendations for abortive CVS therapies included the use of oral and intravenous (IV) 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT PROSPERO 2022 CRD42022310108; available at: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022310108.

Organisms that overwinter in temperate climates may experience freezing and freezing-induced oxidative stress during winter. While many insect species can survive freezing, reverse genetics techniques such as RNA interference (RNAi) have not been used to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying freeze tolerance. The spring field cricket Gryllus veletis can survive freezing following a 6-week fall-like acclimation. We used RNAi to knock down expression of an antioxidant enzyme in G. veletis to test the hypothesis that minimizing oxidative stress is important for freeze tolerance. In fat body tissue, Catalase mRNA abundance and enzyme activity increased during the fall-like acclimation that induces freeze tolerance. Other tissues such as midgut and Malpighian tubules had more stable or lower Catalase expression and activity during this acclimation. In summer-acclimated (freeze-intolerant) crickets, RNA interference (RNAi) effectively knocked down production of the Catalase mRNA and protein in fat body and midgut, but not Malpighian tubules. In fall-acclimated (freeze-tolerant) crickets, RNAi efficacy was temperature-dependent, functioning well at warm (c. 22 °C) but not cool (15 °C or lower) temperatures. This highlights a challenge of using RNAi in organisms acclimated to low temperatures, as they may need to be warmed up for RNAi to work, potentially affecting their stress physiology. Knockdown of Catalase via RNAi in fall-acclimated crickets also had no effect on the ability of the crickets to survive a mild freeze treatment, suggesting that Catalase may not be necessary for freeze tolerance. Our study is the first to demonstrate that RNAi is possible in a freeze-tolerant insect, but further research is needed to examine whether other genes and antioxidants are needed for G. veletis freeze tolerance.

Mathematical modeling of tuberculosis using Caputo fractional derivative: a comparative analysis with real data.	In this study, we investigate an epidemiological model for tuberculosis in China using the Caputo fractional-order derivative. To ensure dimensional consistency, we appropriately adjust model parameters to maintain uniform units. The mathematical properties of the model, including the non-negativity, boundedness, existence, and uniqueness of its solutions, are thoroughly examined and established. Sensitivity analysis, based on the basic reproduction number, is performed to evaluate the impact of critical parameters on disease dynamics, and additional insights are provided through 3D mesh and contour plots, which illustrate how key parameters influence tuberculosis transmission. We estimate the model parameters, including the fractional-order derivative, and determine that the optimal fractional order, which best fits the real data, is approximately 0.93. Numerical simulations are performed using the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method. By utilizing the root mean square error (RMSE) metric, the fractional-order model demonstrates an efficiency improvement of approximately 28.5% compared to its integer-order counterpart, highlighting the superior accuracy of fractional-order models in describing tuberculosis transmission dynamics. These findings underscore the significance of fractional-order models in epidemiological analysis. They provide a more refined approach for modeling infectious diseases and aiding in public health decision-making.

Entanglement and coherence in pure and doped Posner molecules.	The potential role of spin in biological systems is a primary topic in quantum biology. However, much of this research focuses on electron spin. A recent hypothesis suggests that nuclear spin may be better suited to biological processes, being less sensitive to decoherence. The hypothesis details how phosphorus nuclei might be prepared in a spin entangled state, how this entanglement is protected by assembly into calcium phosphate (Posner) molecules, and how this entanglement might modulate calcium ion production and concomitant neural activation. In this paper we investigate the robustness of quantum effects such as coherence and entanglement in Posner molecules. We investigate how these effects are directly dependent on specific parameters such as spin-spin coupling strengths and Posner molecule symmetry. We also investigate how lithium isotope doped Posner molecules differentially modulate quantum resources such as coherence and entanglement and whether this is a viable explanation for lithium's mechanism of action in bipolar disease. Finally we illustrate how entanglement might possibly be preserved through exploitation of the biological environment.

The role of heme in sepsis induced Kupffer cell PANoptosis and senescence.	Elevated heme levels, a consequence of hemolysis, are strongly associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial infections and adverse sepsis outcomes, particularly in older populations. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis, we demonstrate that elevated heme levels correlate with Kupffer cell loss, increased bacterial burden, and heightened mortality. Mechanistically, we identify mitochondrial damage as a key driver of heme- and bacterial-induced Kupffer cell PANoptosis, a form of cell death integrating pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, as well as cellular senescence. Specifically, heme activates phospholipase C gamma (PLC-γ), facilitating the translocation of cleaved gasdermin D (c-GSDMD) to mitochondria, resulting in GSDMD pore formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) during bacterial infection. This mitochondrial damage amplifies PANoptosis and triggers the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, further driving immune senescence. Notably, PLC-γ inhibition significantly reduces mitochondrial damage, cell death, and senescence caused by heme and bacterial infection. Furthermore, we show that hemopexin, a heme scavenger, effectively mitigates sepsis-induced Kupffer cell death and senescence, enhances bacterial clearance, and improves survival outcomes in both young and aged mice. These findings establish mitochondrial damage as a central mediator of heme induced Kupffer cell loss and highlight PLC-γ inhibition and hemopexin administration as promising therapeutic strategies for combating sepsis associated immune dysfunction.

A Half-Century Review of Male and Female Resident Outcomes in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: A Single-Institution Report.	Limited comprehensive historical data exist comparing male and female residents in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) residency programs. This gap underscores the need to examine sex-based differences to guide equitable policies and practices. The purpose of this study is to measure and compare historical enrollment and graduation records between male and female residents within a single OMS residency program. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the University of North Carolina OMS graduation records from 1972 to 2023. The sample was composed of all trainees admitted to the program. All residents still in training, however, were not included in the analyses of postgraduate accomplishments. The independent variable was sex, categorized as male or female. The outcome variables were attrition and training accomplishments. We documented medical degree, board certification, postgraduate training, and postgraduate employment for each graduate. There was no covariate in the study. Fisher's exact and χ The sample was composed of 148 admitted residents. Women comprised 19.6% (29) of total enrollees. Over time, the proportion of females admitted to the program increased from 0.8% (1/12) to 50% (8/16), P = .002. Among the 115 graduates, 13% (15/115) were women. The attrition rates for male and female residents prior to 2000 were 12% (8/65) and 50% (3/6), respectively (P = .04). However, no statistically significant difference was observed after 2000, (P = .5). postgraduate training (P = .42), postgraduate employment settings (P = .42), board certification status (P = .58), and completion of a medical degree (P = .18) did not differ significantly by sex. The University of North Carolina OMS program has seen an increased female representation since its program inception. While female trainees in the past had higher attrition rates, current data no longer support this. Postgraduation outcomes, including postgraduate training, medical degree, board certification, and entry into academic practice-are comparable between male and female graduates. A broader national analysis is recommended to determine if these findings are consistent across other programs.

Lithium is a first-line maintenance treatment for bipolar-disorder (BD) but has increased risk for chronic-kidney-disease (CKD). There is a paucity of research on risk-model development predicting CKD during/following lithium treatment, and none was conducted in Asian regions. This study aimed to derive and validate 10-year risk prediction model for CKD-stage 3 in first-diagnosed BD patients receiving ≥ 1 prescription of lithium during 2002-2018 in Hong-Kong, using electronic-medical-record database of public-healthcare services. Literature-informed predictor selection included demographics, physical comorbidities, mean lithium serum-levels and non-lithium psychotropic use. The risk-equation was developed using Least-Absolute-Shrinkage-and-Selection-Operator (LASSO) Cox-proportional hazards regression model with 4-fold internal cross-validation over 1,000 iterations. We identified 2,258 lithium-treated BD patients, with CKD incidence of 12.6 per 1000 person-years (95 %CI=11.1-14.4) over a median follow-up of 7.7 years (interquartile range=3.7-12.3). Our results showed that older age at BD-diagnosis, male sex, physical comorbidities, higher mean lithium serum-level, fewer antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing anticonvulsant use, and greater antidepressant exposure were independent risk factors predicting CKD, with an event-per-variable ratio of 25.2. The 10-year risk prediction model had satisfactory area-under-the-curve (AUC) (0.74 [95 %CI=0.66-0.83]), with good calibration (calibration slope=0.88 [95 %CI=0.61-1.15]; observed/expected risk ratio=1.14 [95 %CI=0.86-1.42]), and discrimination performances (Harrell's C-index=0.75 [95 %CI=0.68-0.82]; Royston and Sauerbrei's D statistic=1.45 [95 %CI=0.99-1.92]). In conclusion, this CKD risk-model for lithium-treated BD patients demonstrated satisfactory prediction performance in a predominantly-Chinese population. Further research including external validation is needed to verify model performance to facilitate implementation of this CKD risk prediction tool for individualized clinical decision-making and outcomes in real-world practice.

Brief Report: School Anxiety, School Attendance and School Refusal/Distress Following an Autism-Specific Parent-Mediated Intervention for Anxiety in Preschoolers.	Autistic children have an increased likelihood of experiencing anxiety, even in the preschool years. Studies evaluating anxiety interventions in autistic children have tended to focus upon home or community settings. This study expands upon previous work to evaluate whether a parent-mediated intervention for autistic preschool children's anxiety impacts later school anxiety and school attendance. Data for this study comes from a randomised controlled trial of an autism-specific program designed to reduce and/or prevent anxiety in autistic preschoolers; CLK-CUES. In addition to pre- and post-group anxiety measures, the trial included data from parents and teachers one year later, once the children started school. Teacher-reported school anxiety and parent-reported school attendance data were available for the CLK-CUES (n = 15) and control group (n = 13). Children whose parents received CLK-CUES had lower levels of separation anxiety in school and significantly lower non-attendance rates than the control group. This was predominantly due to a significant between-group difference in the number of days missed due to school refusal/distress. Findings indicate promise for this autism-specific anxiety program to reduce school anxiety and support school attendance in young autistic children. Further research with larger samples and an extended follow-up is warranted.	Anxious; Non-attendance; School exclusion; School refusal; Treatment

Association of Substance Use with Types of Assault-Related Injury Among Black Men in Baltimore, Maryland.	Black men in Baltimore, Maryland experience high rates of assault-related injuries, and the association between substance use and assault-related injury is unclear. The purpose of this study is to examine substance use in association with types of assault-related injury (blunt force, stabbing, and firearm). Black men aged 18-34 admitted to a large trauma center in Baltimore, Maryland with an assault-related injury and toxicology screen between 2013 and 2017 ( Cannabis was more frequently detected (42.5%), followed by alcohol (24.4%), opioids (22.3%), and cocaine (3.6%). Over one quarter of men screened positive for multiple substances (25.8%). Men who screened positive for alcohol use were 134% more likely to have been stabbed vs. shot and 54% more likely to have been beaten (i.e., blunt force assault) vs. shot. Men who screened positive for cannabis had a 32% lower risk of experiencing a stabbing compared to firearm assault, and 50% lower risk of experiencing a blunt force compared to firearm assault. Among Black men who received care for an assault-related injury, those who were shot were more likely to have screened positive for cannabis and less likely to have screened positive for alcohol. Socio-contextual factors and acute intoxication effects may explain why differing substance types were associated with different types of assault injury. Future research should examine environmental and social contexts of substance use types among assault-injured men.	assault-related injury; blunt force assault; firearm assault; stabbing assault; substance use

Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a type of metal additive manufacturing which could benefit from improved process monitoring to improve quality control. We demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, the coaxial monitoring of melt track formation in steel powder with spatial frequency modulation imaging (SPIFI), an enhanced-resolution imaging technique which uses a photodiode to record one-dimensional images. Using a custom live-display software and a high-speed SPIFI geometry, we offset the SPIFI field of view from the fusing beam to monitor different regions of the LPBF melt pool and surrounding area. This demonstrates the potential of SPIFI to monitor spatial features within the melt pool in real-time with increased data efficiency.

Assessment of Non-Cereal Products Gluten Cross-Contamination Exposure Risk in a Polish Female Population of Patients Diagnosed with Coeliac Disease.	Following gluten-free diet is challenging, due to risk of gluten cross-contamination. The study aimed to assess the non-cereal products gluten cross-contamination exposure risk in patients with coeliac disease. The study was conducted in a population of 699 Polish female members of the Polish Coeliac Society purchasing gluten-free products on-line (445 patients, 254 relatives). Participants were asked about frequency of buying and availability of gluten-free alternatives of non-cereal products characterized by the gluten cross-contamination risk ('hidden' gluten sources). The most frequently bought non-cereal gluten-free alternatives of the 'hidden' gluten sources were baking powders, spices, side dishes, ice cream, chocolate and chocolate products, snack bars and candies. The caregivers often declared buying 'often' gluten-free baking powder, snack bars, chocolate and chocolate products, candies, ice cream, as well as often declared problems with the availability of gluten-free spices, chocolate and chocolate products, while patients often declared buying 'often' gluten-free beer, as well as often declared problems with its availability. The older respondents often declared buying 'often' gluten-free baking powder, while younger respondents often declared buying 'often' gluten-free chocolate and chocolate products, as well as often declared problems with the availability of gluten-free instant soups, and beer. The respondents living in small towns/villages often declared problems with the availability of gluten-free powder sauces. The respondents not purchasing in hypermarkets often declared buying 'often' gluten-free baking powder, spices, candies. The respondents who most often purchased gluten-free products often declared problems with the availability of gluten-free side dishes, chocolate and chocolate products. The majority of patients diagnosed with coeliac disease do not buy a number of gluten-free alternatives of the 'hidden' gluten sources, so they may be prone to gluten exposure, due to non-cereal products' gluten cross-contamination risk.	availability; coeliac disease; consumers; cross-contamination; exposure; gluten; gluten-free products

EEG-Based Engagement Monitoring in Cognitive Games.	Cognitive decline and dementia prevention are global priorities, with cognitive rehabilitation games showing potential to delay their onset or progression. However, these games require sufficient user engagement to be effective. Assessing the engagement through questionnaires is challenging for the individuals suffering from cognitive decline due to age or dementia.

The association between traumatic temporomandibular joint bony ankylosis and depressive disorder in growing rats.	The psychological symptoms of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis were similar to that of depressive disorder, but there were no relevant evidences to confirm that the humans or animals with TMJ ankylosis had depressive disorder. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between TMJ ankylosis and depressive disorder in the rat model. Thirty 3-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used in this study. The damage of TMJ complexes and narrowed joint space were performed in the unilateral TMJ of test group to induce TMJ bony ankylosis (experimental side). The other TMJ of test group underwent a sham operation (sham side). The TMJs of control group did not undergo any operations. At 8 weeks postoperatively, behavioral tests, body weight, passive maximum mouth opening (PMMO), and TMJ morphological features were evaluated, and the hippocampuses were analyzed using western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The data was compared between the test group and control group by independent t-test, between the experimental side and sham side by paired t-test. The correlations between PMMO/area of bony fusion and duration of immobility, sucrose preference, CB1 receptor protein, mean optical density of CB1 receptor protein, and the number of BrdU-positive cell were evaluated using linear regression analysis. The level of significance was 0.05. In the test group, the traumatic TMJ complexes with narrowed joint space developed TMJ bony ankylosis, the area of bony mass of experimental side (21.26 mm The present study verified that depressive disorder was found in the rat model of traumatic TMJ bony ankylosis. The severity of TMJ bony ankylosis correlated with the severity of depressive disorder.

Non-surgical endodontics: contemporary biomechanical preparation of the root canal system.	Treatment of apical periodontitis requires disinfection of the root canal system through means of biomechanical preparation. This is achieved by a process of shaping the root canal space while simultaneously using antibacterial agents to reduce microbiological load in the root canal system in order for inflammation of the periradicular tissues to resolve and the body to heal itself. The fundamental principles underlying this process have not changed in decades; however, in contrast, the armamentarium available to the clinician continues to evolve rapidly. Nickel-titanium file design has made a significant step forward in the last ten years. Areas of development have focused on the metallurgic properties, motion of the instrument and cross-sectional design. The resulting contemporary designs have allowed the clinician to manage more complex root canal systems more predictably in situations which would otherwise have proved difficult using conventional techniques; effectively, it has made it easier to prepare a root canal. These newer systems also require fewer instruments to prepare a canal and some, which have adopted a reciprocating (rotational) motion, may only require one engine-driven file. Significant energy has been devoted to attempting to enhance efficacy of irrigant activity using different techniques. Although this has shown promise in in vitro studies, this has yet to be shown to translate to an improved clinical success rate based on comparative clinical studies performed. Contemporary biomechanical techniques used to clean and shape the root canal system should result in improved confidence and predictability when managing endodontic disease.

RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is essential for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis, driving ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes. Transcription initiation by Pol I requires core factor (CF) binding to the core element (CE) of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter. Despite structural conservation across species, significant sequence variability suggests CF recognizes DNA through structural features rather than specific sequences. We investigated CF's DNA binding preferences to elucidate the role of DNA structural properties in CE recognition. Analysis of CE sequences from 35 fungal species revealed conserved structural features, notably a rigid AT-rich patch at positions -22 to -20 and a conserved G base pair at position -24. Competition-based electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with single base-pair substitutions showed CF tolerates mutations at many positions but is sensitive to changes in the AT-rich patch. Loss of CF binding correlated with alterations in DNA structural properties such as increased bendability, decreased curvature, widened minor groove width, and altered helix twist. In vitro SELEX experiments identified novel CE sequences preferentially bound by CF, exhibiting increased GC content, higher bendability, and decreased curvature despite lacking sequence conservation. Classification based on bendability profiles revealed CF preferentially binds bendable sequences. In vivo selection assays confirmed these findings, demonstrating consistent CF binding preferences within a cellular context. Our results indicate that CF recognizes and binds to the CE primarily through specific DNA structural features rather than nucleotide sequences. Structural properties like bendability, curvature, and minor groove width are critical determinants of CF binding, facilitating effective Pol I transcription initiation.

Maternal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and epitope level antibody response to vaccines against measles and rubella in children from the Boston birth cohort.	Previous studies suggest that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may act as immune suppressants. However, research about the impact of PFAS exposure on antibody responses to the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is limited and inconsistent. This report includes 748 mother-child pairs from the Boston Birth Cohort, with 8 PFAS compounds measured in maternal plasma shortly after delivery. IgG reactivities to measles and rubella were profiled in cord blood and venous blood plasma during early childhood, using Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing. Linear regression models were applied to assess the relationships between log2-transformed PFAS and IgG reactivities as measured by Viral Aggregate Reactivity score (VARscore, with inverse normal transformation) for measles and rubella. Quantile g-computation was applied to evaluate the PFAS mixture - VARscore associations. The detection rate for 8 PFAS compounds ranged from 90 % to 100 % in maternal plasma. Maternal PFAS burden score (P = 0.01), but not individual PFAS compounds, was associated with lower VARscore for measles in cord blood. In 348 children after receiving the MMR vaccine, three maternal PFAS compounds (Me-PFOSA-AcOH, PFHpS and PFHxS) were significantly associated with lower measles VARscore (P < 0.05). Me-PFOSA-AcOH and PFHxS were significantly associated with higher risk of having low reactivity to measles defined as VARscore < 25th percentile. PFAS mixture analysis revealed a significant inverse association between quantile of the PFAS mixture and measles VARscore (P = 0.025) in children after vaccination, with PFHxS as an important contributor to this association. These inverse associations were more pronounced in Black children (compared to non-Black children) and in preterm children (compared to term children). In comparison, no associations were found for rubella VARscore. This prospective birth cohort study provides suggestive evidence that maternal PFAS exposure is associated with a reduced immune response to the measles vaccine, especially, among Black or preterm children.

One in 10 individuals has a rare disease, with exome and genome sequencing yielding an overall diagnostic rate of approximately 30 %. RNA sequencing can augment genome analysis and improve diagnosis. We present a young woman with global developmental delay, poor growth, distinctive facial features, osteopenia, premature ovarian insufficiency, and ocular abnormalities who had non-diagnostic genome sequencing. RNAseq performed on her skin fibroblasts showed that NBAS gene expression was significantly reduced compared with controls. Manual inspection of the binary alignment map (BAM) files revealed compound heterozygous variants in NBAS: a rare deep intronic variant NM_015909.4:c.2423 + 403G > C which creates a hypomorphic pseudoexon not seen in control samples (gnomad allele frequency (AF) 0.000006572); and a rare premature termination codon (PTC) NM_015909.4:c.4753C > T; p.Arg1585Ter (gnomad AF 0.000006572). Both variants are predicted to cause nonsense mediated decay of transcripts, as the pseudoexon contains a PTC. Biallelic variants in NBAS are associated with two major phenotypes, i.e., infantile liver failure syndrome 2 (MIM # 616483) and short stature, optic nerve atrophy, and Pelger-Huet anomaly (MIM # 614800). Our patient, the first reported with one loss of function and one splice variant resulting in an out of frame transcript in NBAS, manifested a severe phenotype compared with previously reported individuals. This case demonstrates the utility of incorporating RNAseq to generate diagnostic candidates and expands the phenotypic spectrum of NBAS deficiency.

Truth-telling is required for health equity for Aboriginal peoples: A qualitative study.	The World Health Assembly has called for a Global Action Plan to address health inequities imposed upon Indigenous peoples. In seeking equity, Aboriginal peoples and allies have called for truth-telling about colonisation and its relation to healthcare. Australian healthcare, largely based on the biomedical model, is inadequate in terms of design, delivery, and access for Aboriginal peoples. Healthcare employees are known to contribute to health inequities. This study explores non-Indigenous healthcare employee perceptions and experiences of engaging with Aboriginal peoples. Forty-nine health professionals from an Australian hospital participated in qualitative interviews. Interviews were audio-recorded, and data analysed with reflexive thematic analysis. Interviewees volunteered for the study and were first recruited in January 2020. The study is not registered. Four themes were identified, including perceptions of: colonisation, Aboriginal peoples and knowledges, racism toward Aboriginal people, and healthcare inequities imposed upon Aboriginal people. Many participants were oblivious to how colonisation and racism create present healthcare inequities. This limited understanding was a consequence of feelings of distress and subsequent disengagement with the history of colonisation. Healthcare education requires better truth-telling methods to achieve health equity. We suggest trials of collaborative modes of education from arts and humanities that simultaneously recognise continuing colonial ideology and promote antiracism. Crucially, as the World Health Assembly notes, from design to implementation, these strategies must foreground and involve Aboriginal peoples, and deeper understanding of what it is to be an Indigenous ally.

A Lingual Ultrasound Study of Speech in Patients With Cleft Lip and Palate Following Orthognathic Surgery.	This study evaluated the effects of orthognathic surgery on speech of Class III ('underbite') patients with repaired cleft lip and palate (CLP) through ultrasound imaging, aerodynamic assessment and articulatory analyses before and after surgery to evaluate how surgery impacts articulation, velopharyngeal (VP) function and hypernasality. Tongue gestures of five Class III patients with repaired CLP, five Class III patients without CLP and five Class I controls were visualised through ultrasound imaging pre- and post-surgery. Tongue Dorsum Excursion Index and Tongue Constraint Position Index (TCPI) were calculated using ultrasound, and VP insufficiency (VPI) indices were measured using pressure flow assessment and compared with qualitative-perceptual ratings by Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs). Linear mixed-effects models were used to test for significant post-operative changes in Dorsum Excursion Index and TCPI among consonants. Pressure flow measures are expected to estimate VP gap size during speech using PERCI-SARS. Patients with CLP had significantly lower Dorsum Excursion Index for /k/ before front (p = 0.001) and back vowels (p < 0.001). TCPI revealed consistently lower values for patients with CLP than controls and Class III patients, with inter- and intra-speaker variation for all consonants. Pressure flow data of two patients with CLP showed evidence of VPI and altered nasality post-surgery. Patients with CLP present with lower Dorsum Excursion Index and TCPI when compared to controls, suggesting more anterior tongue positioning. Dorsum Excursion Index and TCPI can be used to understand tongue shape and movement changes, potentially elucidating functional effects of jaw surgery on speech. Dorsum Excursion Index and pressure flow data indicate increased compensatory articulations and VPI after orthognathic surgery for patients with CLP, impacting speech.

Real-World Applications of Imipenem-Cilastatin-Relebactam: Insights From a Multicenter Observational Cohort Study.	Multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative infections are a substantial threat to patients and public health. Imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam (IMI/REL) is a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor with expanded activity against MDR This was a retrospective, multicenter, observational study of patients ≥18 years old who received IMI/REL for ≥48 hours for a suspected or confirmed gram-negative infection. The primary outcome was clinical success, defined as improvement or resolution of infection-related signs or symptoms while receiving IMI/REL and the absence of 30-day microbiologic failure. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of clinical success. The study included 151 patients from 24 US medical centers. IMI/REL was predominantly prescribed for lower respiratory tract infections, accounting for 52.3% of cases. Most patients were infected with a carbapenem-nonsusceptible pathogen (85.4%); This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the real-world effectiveness and safety of IMI/REL. Comparative studies and investigations of specific subgroups will further enhance our understanding of IMI/REL in treating MDR infections.

The Construction of Community at Early Bronze Age Karataş-Semayük, Southwestern Anatolia.	The present study seeks to examine biological kinship structures as expressed in mortuary treatment and postmarital residence practices of the Early Bronze Age (c. 3000-2000 BCE) Karataş-Semayük in southwestern Anatolia. Dental morphology and metrics of 451 (n Individuals did not cluster based on burial location or unit for either the Gower's or NEFRC analyses. Additionally, rare traits were not clustered in specific burial locations. Females consistently showed greater metric and morphological variation compared to males, reaching statistical significance in mean pairwise difference tests. These results suggest that burial location was not strongly defined by biological kinship units or lineages. Rather, a negotiation of various social identities likely influenced the expression of group membership in mortuary practice. Additionally, Karataş-Semayük likely practiced a bilocal residence pattern with a virilocal bias. The significant incorporation of outside females in the local community and the lack of biologically constrained burial practice may have simultaneously contributed to a cohesive community identity.	dental metrics; dental morphology; kinship; postmarital residence

Neighbourhood out-of-home food environment, menu healthiness, and their associations with meal purchasing and diet quality: a multiverse analysis.	Governments worldwide have implemented various interventions to improve the healthiness of food offered by out-of-home outlets. However, there is limited evidence on whether healthier menus would influence individual dietary behaviours and quality. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated associations between different measures of the neighbourhood out-of-home food environment, incorporating menu healthiness, and out-of-home meal purchasing and diet quality. We used a sample of 3,481 adults in Great Britain (GB) with valid home postcodes from the 2021 International Food Policy Study. We linked this sample to a national database of food outlet geographical locations to characterise individuals' exposure to the out-of-home food environment. The exposure metrics included menu healthiness scores, availability, proximity, and relative composition of out-of-home food outlets in various neighbourhood buffers around the home (i.e., 500 - 1600 m). Outcomes considered were out-of-home meal consumption and overall diet quality. Using multiverse analyses, where multiple reasonable analytical choices can be tested, we investigated the associations between different exposure measures and these outcomes. GB adults had access to an average of 97 (95% CI 91, 104) out-of-home food outlets within 1600 m of their homes. The number of both healthier and less healthy out-of-home food outlets was positively associated with the number of meals purchased out-of-home across all neighbourhood buffers, e.g., every 10 additional less healthy out-of-home food outlets within 500 m of the home corresponded to a 6% (95% CI = 2, 11) increase in the frequency of out-of-home meal purchases in the previous week. Proximity, relative composition, and menu healthiness of neighbourhood out-of-home outlets were not associated with out-of-home meal purchase frequency after adjusting for multiple comparisons. There were no consistent associations between out-of-home food environment exposures and diet quality. The only aspect of the neighbourhood out-of-home food environment associated with out-of-home meal purchase frequency was the number of out-of-home food outlets. Menu healthiness of out-of-home food outlets was not associated with how often people purchased out-of-home meals or overall diet quality. Interventions focusing on mitigating the proliferation of out-of-home food outlets may be more effective in changing individual dietary behaviour than those focusing on food served.

Bridging the gaps in the unmet needs of hypertension care in Nigeria: post-intervention evaluation of the community action against non-communicable diseases (COMAAND) project.	Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), of which hypertension is one of the major drivers, have become a global public health burden, leading to at least 70% of deaths globally. Community action against non-Communicable diseases (COMAAND) is an innovative community-based intervention focused on improving the early detection and timely management of hypertension in Nigeria. In this report, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in improving key hypertension management outcomes including hypertension awareness, treatment, and blood pressure control after two years of implementing the intervention (between November 2019 to January 2022). We evaluated the COMAAND intervention using a mixed method design (combining cross-sectional survey and longitudinal study). We conducted a community-wide cross-sectional survey to assess community level awareness, treatment, and blood pressure control at the end of the two years of intervention implementation. We used the one sample chi-squared test to compare categorical variables, and the one sample t-test for continuous variable between the pre-intervention and the post-intervention study. We also collected longitudinal data of patients enrolled at participating health care facilities and evaluated treatment adherence. The mean age of the participants was 47 years, with no significant difference from that of the pre-intervention survey.

Perinatal outcomes in cases of umbilical-portal-systemic venous shunts: experience of a tertiary center.	The umbilical-ductal-portal system attracts significant interest due to its specific connections in fetal life. Advances in the detailed examination of hepatic circulation have further intensified this interest in recent years. Present study aimed to evaluate the obstetric and perinatal outcomes of patients diagnosed with umbilical-portal-systemic venous shunts (UPSVS) at our clinic. This study involved a retrospective analysis covering the period from September 2019 to June 2024. Detailed anatomical screening, fetal echocardiography, and invasive genetic testing (for patients who consent) were performed on cases of fetal UPSVS. Accompanying anomalies, ductus venosus, the intrahepatic portal system, and hepatic veins were examined in detail. During the specified period, 20 patients were identified to have UPSVS, with a mean gestational age of 25 weeks at the time of diagnosis. Of these cases, five (25%) were classified as umbilical-systemic shunt (USS), three (15%) as ductus venosus-systemic shunt (DVSS), twelve (60%) as intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (IHPSS). Ductus venosus was absent in 70% (n = 14) of the cases. Chromosomal analysis was conducted on 11 fetuses either prenatally or postnatally. Trisomy 21 was detected in two fetuses, 45,X0 in one fetus, a variant of Adams-Oliver syndrome in one fetus, and Adams-Oliver syndrome in another. Pregnancy was terminated in three cases due to chromosomal or additional congenital anomalies. In one case, intrauterine fetal death occurred at 22 weeks of gestation. Sixteen live births were recorded, of which two neonates died due to accompanying congenital anomalies, one at 2 h postnatally and the other on the 10 th postnatal day. UPSVS are increasingly detected in the presence of major structural or chromosomal anomalies. The prognosis of isolated cases is generally favorable; however, the exact incidence remains unknown.

A Phase Ia/b study of MEK1/2 inhibitor binimetinib with MET inhibitor crizotinib in patients with RAS mutant advanced colorectal cancer (MErCuRIC).	Targeting RAS mutant (MT) colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a difficult challenge, mainly due to the pervasiveness of RAS/MEK-mediated feedback loops. Preclinical studies identified MET/STAT3 as an important mediator of resistance to KRAS-MEK1/2 blockade in RASMT CRC. This dose escalation/expansion study assessed safety and initial efficacy of the MEK1/2 inhibitor binimetinib with MET inhibitor crizotinib in RASMT advanced CRC patients. In the dose escalation phase, patients with advanced solid tumours received binimetinib with crizotinib, using a rolling- 6 design to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and safety/tolerability. A subsequent dose expansion in RASMT CRC patients assessed treatment response. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics, MET biomarker and ctDNA analyses, and skin/tumour biopsies for pharmacodynamics, c-MET immunohistochemistry (IHC), MET in situ hybridisation (ISH) and MET DNA-ISH analyses were collected. Twenty patients were recruited in 3 cohorts in the dose escalation. The MTD was binimetinib 30 mg B.D, days 1-21 every 28 days, with crizotinib 250 mg O.D continuously. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade ≥ 3 transaminitis, creatinine phosphokinase increases and fatigue. Thirty-six RASMT metastatic CRC patients were enrolled in the dose expansion. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters showed evidence of target engagement. Across the entire study, the most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TR-AE) were rash (80.4%), fatigue (53.4%) and diarrhoea (51.8%) with grade ≥ 3 TR-AE occurring in 44.6%. Best clinical response within the RASMT CRC cohort was stable disease in seven patients (24%). Tumour MET super-expression (IHC H-score > 180 and MET ISH + 3) was observed in 7 patients (24.1%), with MET-amplification only present in 1 of these patients. This patient discontinued treatment early during cycle 1 due to toxicity. Patients with high baseline RASMT allele frequency had a significant shorter median overall survival compared with that seen for patients with low baseline KRASMT allele frequency. Combination binimetinib/crizotinib showed a poor tolerability with no objective responses observed in RASMT advanced CRC patients.

A working group report from the 2024 NCI/GCSC endometrial cancer clinical trials planning meeting: refining the approach to endometrial cancer in the immunotherapy era.	"Endometrial cancer (EC) is now the leading cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States. Recognizing the urgent need to improve outcomes for patients diagnosed with EC, The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Gynecologic Cancer Steering Committee (GCSC) convened a Clinical Trials Planning Meeting (CTPM) on January 8th and 9th 2024, ""Refining the Approach to Endometrial Cancer in the Immunotherapy Era."" Multi-disciplinary experts were charged with addressing critical challenges, to optimize treatment of EC in the new immunotherapy landscape. As part of the CTPM working groups were assembled to address several important aspects of clinical trial design. Working Group 1 (WG1) focused on translational science and was tasked with reviewing the scientific literature for data on validated discriminants of response to immunotherapy to inform trial concept development by the therapy-focused groups. The WG established that molecular subtyping of EC is now the standard approach for classifying endometrial tumors. Molecular subtyping for both prognostic and predictive applications should be considered when assessing biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. Additionally, strategies to improve immune response like incorporation of radiation as well as therapy sequencing considerations should continue to be explored. A major key observation from WG1 was lack of validated discriminants for immunotherapy response beyond mismatch repair status and tumor mutational burden and exploration of additional discriminants of response and resistance will be critical with the increasing use of immunotherapy in EC."

Hyperinflammatory repolarisation of ovarian cancer patient macrophages by anti-tumour IgE antibody, MOv18, restricts an immunosuppressive macrophage:Treg cell interaction.	Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological cancer and treatment options remain limited. In a recent first-in-class Phase I trial, the monoclonal IgE antibody MOv18, specific for the tumour-associated antigen Folate Receptor-α, was well-tolerated and preliminary anti-tumoural activity observed. Pre-clinical studies identified macrophages as mediators of tumour restriction and pro-inflammatory activation by IgE. However, the mechanisms of IgE-mediated modulation of macrophages and downstream tumour immunity in human cancer remain unclear. Here we study macrophages from patients with epithelial ovarian cancers naive to IgE therapy. High-dimensional flow cytometry and RNA-seq demonstrate immunosuppressive, FcεR-expressing macrophage phenotypes. Ex vivo co-cultures and RNA-seq interaction analyses reveal immunosuppressive associations between patient-derived macrophages and regulatory T (Treg) cells. MOv18 IgE-engaged patient-derived macrophages undergo pro-inflammatory repolarisation ex vivo and display induction of a hyperinflammatory, T cell-stimulatory subset. IgE reverses macrophage-promoted Treg cell induction to increase CD8+ T cell expansion, a signature associated with improved patient prognosis. On-treatment tumours from the MOv18 IgE Phase I trial show evidence of this IgE-driven immune signature, with increased CD68+ and CD3+ cell infiltration. We demonstrate that IgE induces hyperinflammatory repolarised states of patient-derived macrophages to inhibit Treg cell immunosuppression. These processes may collectively promote immune activation in ovarian cancer patients receiving IgE therapy.

Co-contaminant risks in water reuse and biosolids application for agriculture.	Agriculture made the shift toward resource reuse years ago, incorporating materials such as treated wastewater and biosolids. Since then, research has documented the widespread presence of contaminants of emerging concern in agricultural systems. Chemicals such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals and poly- and -perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs); particulate matter such as nanomaterials and microplastics; and biological agents such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacteria (ARB) are inadvertently introduced into arable soils where they can be taken up by crops and introduced to the food-web. Thus, concern about the presence of contaminants in agricultural environments has grown in recent years with evidence emerging linking agricultural exposure and accumulation in crops to ecosystem and human health effects. Our current assessment of risk is siloed by working within disciplines (i.e., chemistry and microbiology) and mostly focused on individual chemical classes. By not acknowledging the fact that contaminants are mostly introduced as a mixture, with the potential for interactions, with each other and with environmental factors, we are limiting our current approach to evaluate the real potential for ecosystem and human health effects. By uniting expertise across disciplines to integrate recent understanding regarding the risks posed by a range of chemically diverse contaminants in resources destined for reuse, this review provides a holistic perspective on the current regulatory challenges to ensure safe and sustainable reuse of wastewater and biosolids to support a sanitation-agriculture circular economy.

Virta Intervention in CommuniTies in cOloRado Pilot Study (VICTOR-Pilot), to Improve Diabetes and Cardiovascular Risk in Rural Communities Primary Results.	Innovative strategies combining local community health workers (CHW) and digital health may improve type 2 diabetes (T2D) care and cardiovascular (CV) risk in rural communities. To conduct a cluster-randomized, open-label, multi-site study to evaluate the hypothesis that in rural communities served by CHW in the Colorado Heart Healthy Solutions (CHHS) program, referral to a digital continuous care intervention (CCI) would improve hemoglobin A1c (A1c) in patients with T2D as compared with CHHS alone. Adults in the CHHS program with T2D taking at least 1 antihyperglycemic medication, A1c ≥7.5%, body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m Fifty-one (51) individuals had evaluable data. Mean ±SD age was 59.6 ±10 years, body mass index (BMI) 34.4 ±7 kg/m Combining a CHW program with referral to continuous care intervention did not result in greater A1c reduction, but led to improvements in A1c, weight, and medication burden in individuals with type 2 diabetes in a rural setting.	community health worker; diabetes; digital technology; remote; rural

Increasing Use of Cemented Stems is Associated with Reduced Early Fracture after Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative Study.	The Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Quality Collaborative Initiative (MARCQI) identified periprosthetic fracture as the most common reason for early total hip arthroplasty (THA) revision of uncemented hips. This analysis described a state-wide quality improvement project to reduce fracture and early revision. The MARCQI reports data to participants through reports and in-person meetings and incorporated postoperative hip fracture into pay-for-performance incentives as part of a quality improvement project in 2018. The percent of cemented stems and incidence of fracture within 90 days of surgery were analyzed by age, sex, and year of surgery. The overall use of cemented stems in THA rose from 2.7% in 2017 to 6.8% in 2022. Only 0.7% of men and 1.8% of women under 75 years were cemented in 2017 while 4.7 and 10.4% of patients 75 years and older were cemented, respectively. By 2022, 10.8% of men and 26.8% of women 75 years and older were cemented. In elderly women, the incidence of fracture after THA has dropped to 1.7% in 2022 from a peak of 3.5% in 2018 as the use of cement has increased. Early fracture often leads to revision and may be preventable. This analysis demonstrated a direct correlation between the use of cemented stems and decreased postoperative fracture rates in elderly women. Statewide fractures increased from 2012 to 2018 (peak at 1.26%). Since the beginning of the MARCQI fracture reduction quality initiative, there has been a steady decline to 0.96% in 2022. Stratifying by age and sex, cementing in older women increased by 16%, and fracture rates decreased by nearly 2%. With this MARCQI initiative, there were an estimated 280 fewer revisions secondary to fractures in Michigan. Surgeons should consider using cemented femoral stems for THA in elderly women.

Rectal cancer management has changed significantly in the last decade with the introduction of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), minimally invasive surgery, brachytherapy, and organ preservation. A national survey of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was carried out in 2020 to support the development of national Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) guidance, published in 2021. We performed a repeat survey in collaboration with the RCR, to inform iterations of the RCR Guidance and establish treatment patterns across the UK to facilitate future research and development. A web-based survey was developed and tested by the authors prior to dissemination by the RCR to all UK radiotherapy centres. The repeat survey requested details and strategies of current radiotherapy techniques, including details on setup, doses, organs at risk, peer review, and verification, and asked for the standard management of 5 clinical cases within each multidisciplinary team (MDT) serving that radiotherapy centre. Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out. In total, 42 of 60 (70%) of the NHS centres across the UK answered the repeat IMRT rectal survey, which reflected 70 MDTs answering the clinical scenarios questions. 100% of centres that responded are routinely using IMRT, with 95% of centres using it in all patients. Variation in treatment delivery has reduced since the previous survey. The greatest difference is still in the use of simultaneous integrated boost and definition of organs at risk. The management for the clinical cases was widely different, with answers generally equally distributed between 2-4 options. The highest-scoring treatment strategies ranged from 24% to 57%. RCR guidance has helped standardise the delivery of radiotherapy to treat rectal cancer in the UK. The variation in neoadjuvant treatment represents an exciting, evolving time in rectal cancer management. Clinical trials are needed to further homogenise treatment, but a degree of national variation is likely to continue.

Intraoperative Real-Time Fluorescence Labeling of Degenerated Facial Nerves with Bevonescein.	Bevonescein (ALM-488), a nerve-targeted peptide-dye conjugate, enables intraoperative fluorescence of degenerated peripheral nerves due to its extracellular matrix-binding mechanism. In contrast, myelin-based nerve-targeting agents would not be expected to label degenerated nerves due to demyelination. We compare the intraoperative fluorescence of chronically degenerated murine facial nerves produced by bevonescein and myelin-binding dye oxazine-4 and discuss its utility in peripheral nerve reconstruction. Sixteen wild-type mice underwent transection of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve. At five months, ten mice were co-injected with bevonescein and oxazine-4 and underwent intraoperative facial nerve exploration with fluorescence imaging. Signal-to-background ratio (SBR) was calculated by comparing the mean gray value along each nerve segment to adjacent non-nerve tissue. All degenerated nerve segments were visible with bevonescein (100%, n=20 nerves, 10 mice). In contrast, degenerated segments were invisible with oxazine-4 in 6/10 mice (60%, n=12 nerves, 10 mice) and faintly perceptible in 4/10 mice (40%, n = 8 nerves, 10 mice). The mean SBR for oxazine-4 was lower than bevonescein (1.27±0.54 vs 3.31±1.11, p<0.001). Autonomic nerves demonstrated strong fluorescence with bevonescein (SBR = 1.77±0.65; n=7 nerves, 7 mice) but were invisible or faintly visible with oxazine-4 (SBR = 1.11±0.14; n=7 nerves, 7 mice; p=0.02). Bevonescein produces successful intraoperative labeling of chronically degenerated and autonomic nerves in a rodent nerve transection model. In contrast, myelin-binding oxazine-4 does not meaningfully produce fluorescence labeling in these contexts. These findings may influence choice of nerve-labeling agents in the setting of delayed peripheral nerve construction. This study demonstrates the utility of bevonescein, a fluorescein-conjugated nerve-binding peptide, in the identification of degenerated facial nerves during fluorescence-guided surgery. This technology could benefit reconstructive surgeons who perform delayed peripheral nerve reconstruction. 4.

Mapping the extracellular molecular architecture of the pAg-signaling complex with α-Butyrophilin antibodies.	Target cells trigger Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation by signaling the intracellular accumulation of phospho-antigen metabolites (pAgs) through Butyrophilin (BTN)-3A1 and BTN2A1 to the Vγ9Vδ2 T cell receptor (TCR). An incomplete understanding of the molecular dynamics in this signaling complex hampers Vγ9Vδ2 T cell immunotherapeutic efficacy. A panel of engineered α-BTN3A1 and α-BTN2A1 antibody (mAb) reagents was used to probe the roles of BTN3A1 and BTN2A1 in pAg signaling. Modified α-BTN3A1 mAbs with increased inter-Fab distances establish that tight clustering of BTN3A1 is not necessary to stimulate Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation, and that antagonism may occur through occlusion of a critical binding interaction between BTN3A1 and a yet unknown co-receptor. Finally, a panel of additional α-BTN2A1 antagonists utilize different biophysical mechanisms to compete with Vγ9Vδ2 TCRs for BTN2A1 binding. The complex structures of BTN2A1 ectodomain and Fabs from three antagonist mAbs provide molecular insights into BTN2A1 epitopes critical for pAg-signaling.

Challenges and opportunities in ovarian cancer care: A qualitative study of clinician perspectives from 24 low- and middle-income countries.	"Ovarian cancer poses a significant and growing burden, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where incidence and mortality are projected to increase by over 50 % by 2050. However, there is a critical lack of qualitative data on the challenges and opportunities for improvement in treatment and care for women with ovarian cancer in these regions. The aim of this research is to investigate clinicians' perspectives on the matter in 24 LMICs. As part of the multi-country observational Every Woman Study™ (EWS), semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinicians between June 2022 and June 2023. The interview guide was developed by the EWS LMIC Oversight Committee, including patients, clinicians and data specialists. Relational content and inductive thematic analyses were employed and categories synthesized using the World Health Organization's six building blocks of the Health Systems Framework. 24 clinicians (54 % female; 79 % gynaecologic oncologists, 8 % gynaecologists, 8 % clinical oncologists not specializing in gynaecological cancers, and 4 % clinical oncologists specializing in gynaecological cancers; 42 % from Africa, 29 % from Asia, 29 % from Latin America) participated. Six dominant themes were identified: ""Poor Ovarian Cancer Data'', ""Inequity in Access to Treatment"", ""In-Country Inequities in Access to Care"", ""Role of Cultural Norms on Women's Health"", ""Increased Engagement of Men in Ovarian Cancer Control"", and ""Advocacy and Education for Empowering Women"". Content analysis revealed system-level challenges such as delayed drug payments, lack of population-based cancer data, and limited imaging facilities. Patient-level challenges included disparities in access to specialists, limited medication affordability, poor symptom recognition, and reliance on alternative treatments. This study reveals the complexity of ovarian cancer treatment and care in LMICs and the need to mitigate disparities in these regions, underscoring the need for patient-centred, context specific and intersectoral strategies to be considered in cancer planning to improve ovarian cancer care quality and equity in LMICs."

Advancing Workforce Development and Evidence-Based Practice in US Territories: An Evaluation of the Public Health Disaster Research Award Program.	Many people living in the 5 inhabited US territories experience high rates of natural hazard exposure and social vulnerability to disaster impacts. Public health workforce development and evidence-based, culturally competent approaches to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery are needed in these regions. In 2020, the Natural Hazards Center established the Public Health Disaster Research Award Program with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The program's goal is to advance public health disaster research and practice by funding, training, mentoring, and connecting researchers, students, and practitioners in historically underserved areas with high natural hazard risk. Between 2020 and 2022, 26 research teams received up to $50 000 each to investigate public health disasters in 1 or more US territories. The program also supported awardees by providing individual consultations, online trainings, feedback on report drafts, and a virtual group workshop on the public health implications of research. Awardees authored final reports and presented at a public webinar. In 2023, the Natural Hazards Center developed and distributed an online survey to all principal investigators. The survey evaluated how awardees advanced knowledge about public health disasters in the US territories; what skills, resources, and connections they acquired; and how they translated their research into public health applications and otherwise disseminated their findings. Our evaluation showed that the program is advancing knowledge of understudied hazard contexts and socially vulnerable populations in the US territories and supports awardees in sharing their findings with academics, policymakers, and practitioners. Moreover, it expanded the public health disaster workforce by bringing professionals from a diverse range of disciplines and institutions into the field, and by investing in students, early career scholars, and investigators based in US territories. Researchers are working with local partners to apply their findings to practice.	disaster preparedness and response; public health; research grants, US territories; workforce development

ARMC1 partitions between distinct complexes and assembles MIRO with MTFR to control mitochondrial distribution.	Maintaining an optimal mitochondrial distribution is critical to ensure an adequate supply of energy and metabolites to support important cellular functions. How cells balance dynamic mitochondrial processes to achieve homeostasis is incompletely understood. Here, we show that ARMC1 partitioning between distinct mitochondrial protein complexes is a key determinant of mitochondrial distribution. In one complex, the mitochondrial trafficking adaptor MIRO recruits ARMC1, which mediates the assembly of a mitochondrial fission regulator (MTFR). MTFR stability depends on ARMC1, and MIRO-MTFR complexes specifically antagonize retrograde mitochondrial movement. In another complex, DNAJC11 facilitates ARMC1 release from mitochondria. Disrupting MIRO-MTFR assembly fails to rescue aberrant mitochondrial distributions clustered in the perinuclear area observed with ARMC1 deletion, while disrupting ARMC1 interaction with DNAJC11 leads to excessive mitochondrially localized ARMC1 and distinct mitochondrial defects. Thus, the abundance and trafficking impact of MIRO-MTFR complexes require ARMC1, whose mito-cytoplasmic shuttling balanced by DNAJC11 tunes steady-state mitochondrial distributions.

A Randomized Phase 1 Clinical Trial of a Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Human Metapneumovirus Combination Protein-Based Virus-like Particle Vaccine in Adults 60-75 Years of Age.	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are important causes of severe lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in adults ≥65 years of age. We report safety and immunogenicity for IVX-A12, a combination, protein-based virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine against RSV- and hMPV-associated LRTD. This phase 1 trial (NCT05664334) randomized healthy adults 60-75 years of age to receive 1 intramuscular dose of IVX-A12 at low (75 µg RSV/75 µg hMPV), medium (75 µg RSV/150 µg hMPV), or high dose levels (75 µg RSV/225 µg hMPV) ± oil-in-water adjuvant MF59® (low and medium dose levels only), or placebo. Safety and immunogenicity were assessed through day 365 postvaccination. Overall, 140 participants received IVX-A12 (n = 117) or placebo (n = 23). Solicited adverse reactions (ARs) were transient, with mild to moderate severity; ARs were reported by 47.0% (n = 55/117) and 34.8% (n = 8/23) of IVX-A12 and placebo recipients, respectively. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. All IVX-A12 dose levels and formulations boosted preexisting RSV- and hMPV-specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses; from baseline to day 28, nAb titers against RSV A or B increased up to 4- or 3-fold, and nAb titers against hMPV A or B increased up to 5- or 4-fold, respectively. Neutralizing responses in IVX-A12 recipients through day 365 were maintained above or around baseline and exceeded those in placebo recipients.

The Modified Dosages for Acute Malnutrition (MODAM) study: protocol for three integrated randomized controlled trials of novel approaches for the management of childhood wasting in Ethiopia.	"Only a small percentage of children with severe and moderate acute malnutrition receive treatment due to resource limitations, relatively complex treatment protocols, persistent supply chain challenges, and limited early identification among high-risk populations. Several innovations to the current model of care for uncomplicated acute malnutrition have been proposed, including modified doses of nutritional supplementation and family-led mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) and edema screening (""Family MUAC"") for early identification. The evidence base for these innovations remains limited. The Modified Dosages for Acute Malnutrition (MODAM) study includes three integrated individually randomized clinical trials testing innovations in the identification and treatment of acute malnutrition in Ethiopia. One trial will enroll 2400 children aged 6-59 months with severe acute malnutrition, testing standard weight-based dosing of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) against two experimental RUTF dosing regimens: either two sachets (1000 kcal) daily of RUTF until discharge, or two sachets until achieving anthropometric criteria for moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), at which time dosing will be decreased to one sachet (500 kcal) daily until discharge as fully recovered. A second trial will enroll 2400 children with MAM and test a standard dose of one daily sachet (540 kcal) of ready-to-use supplemental food against two experimental dosing regimes: one sachet (500 kcal) or two sachets (1000 kcal) of RUTF daily until discharge. Children who recover from these two trials will be randomized again into a third trial evaluating post-recovery protocols designed for the early identification of relapse: (1) the control arm involving one scheduled return visit at 24 weeks post-recovery; (2) the first intervention arm involving three scheduled return visits at 4, 12, and 24 weeks post-recovery; and (3) the second intervention arm which involves caregivers receiving Family MUAC training and one scheduled visit at 24 weeks post-recovery. This study will provide data on the effectiveness of multiple innovations in the management of childhood acute malnutrition. Results will add to the evidence base on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such modifications in the identification and management of acute malnutrition, ideally adding to the global database on this topic and directly contributing to future WHO guidelines. Trials were registered on clinicaltrials.gov as NCT06038071 (registered September 8, 2023), NCT06056089 (registered September 20, 2023), and NCT06061484 (registered September 24, 2023)."

Monoclonal antibodies have two core mechanisms of protection: an antibody's antigen-binding fragment (Fab) can bind and neutralize viral pathogens and its fragment crystallizable domain (Fc) catalyzes effector functions. We investigated the relative contribution of Fab- versus Fc-mediated mechanisms of protection through passive administration of distinct forms of the pan-reactive anti-influenza antibody CR9114. We demonstrated that the contribution of Fc-independent (Fab-dependent) versus Fc-dependent mechanisms of protection is defined by the route of administration. We used CR9114 variants (wild-type, two Fc-silenced variants, or the bivalent antigen-binding fragment F(ab')

Indigenous Knowledge as a sole data source in habitat selection functions.	While Indigenous Knowledge (IK) contains a wealth of information on the behavior and habitat use of species, it is rarely included in the species-habitat models frequently used by Western species management authorities. As decisions from these authorities can limit access to species that are important culturally and for subsistence, exclusion of IK in conservation and management frameworks can negatively impact both species and Indigenous communities. In partnership with Iñupiat hunters, we developed methods to statistically characterize IK of species-habitat relationships and developed models that rely solely on IK to identify species habitat use and important areas. We provide methods for different types of IK documentation and for dynamic habitat types (e.g., ice concentration). We apply the method to ringed seals (natchiq in Iñupiaq) in Alaskan waters, a stock for which the designated critical habitat has been debated in part due to minimal inclusion of IK. Our work demonstrates that IK of species-habitat relationships, with the inclusion of dynamic habitat types, expands on existing mapping approaches and provides another method to identify species habitat use and important areas. The results of this work provide a straightforward and meaningful approach to include IK in species management, especially through comanagement processes.

Leveraging Accelerometry and Heartrate Data from Consumer Wearables to Predict Physical Activity in Children: A Device Agnostic Approach.	This study examined the potential of a device agnostic approach for predicting physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) from research grade and consumer wearable accelerometry and heartrate (HR) raw data compared to indirect calorimetry in children. Two-hundred and thirty-one 5-12-year-olds (52.4% male) of diverse skin tone and body weights participated in a 60-minute protocol with multiple activities at varying intensities. Children wore two of three consumer wearables (Apple Watch Series 7, Garmin Vivoactive 4S, Fitbit Sense) and a research grade accelerometer (ActiGraph GT9X) on their non-dominant wrist, and a chest-placed, research grade HR monitor (Actiheart 5, ECG), concurrently. Children also wore a K5 criterion measure of PAEE (i.e., COSMED K5). Cross-sectional time series (CSTS), generalized additive mixed effects model (GAMM) and random forest (RF) were used to estimate minute-by-minute PAEE from features extracted from raw accelerometry and HR data. Variance explained (R2), in addition to other metrics, evaluated agreement between estimated and criterion measurements. For the research grade devices (i.e., ActiGraph accelerometry and Actiheart HR) R2 was 0.74, 0.74, and 0.76 for CSTS, GAMM, and RF, respectively. For Apple R2 was 0.77, 0.76, and 0.78, Garmin's was 0.73, 0.73, and 0.75, and Fitbit's was 0.63, 0.65, and 0.67 for CSTS, GAMM, and RF, respectively. Across all other evaluation metrics, a similar pattern was observed with Fitbit performing the worst but with little variability between the modeling approaches or the other devices. Except for Fitbit, accelerometry and HR data from consumer wearables predicted PAEE comparably to research grade devices and there was little variability across modeling approach. These outcomes support deploying a consumer wearable device-agnostic approach for PAEE estimation in children.	FREE-LIVING ACTIVITY MONITORING; OPEN SOURCE; PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TRACKING; VALIDATION

Rural versus urban communities experience disproportionate challenges in breast cancer outcomes, with higher breast cancer mortality and later stage disease presentation, despite similar diagnosis rates. These disparities are driven by structural barriers, including rural hospital closures, transportation difficulties, and limited access to oncology specialists. This study evaluated a train-the-trainer program designed to equip PharmD students located at a pharmacy school in a rural county in South Carolina with breast cancer education training, leveraging the pharmacists' position as accessible healthcare professionals in rural communities. Training focused on breast cancer risk factors, prevention, screening, genetics, staging, and treatment options. Effectiveness was measured through pre- and post-workshop confidence surveys and knowledge assessments. Results showed significant improvement in student confidence across educational domains, with average scores increasing from 6.30 to 8.59 (p<0.0001). Understanding of screening guidelines (mean difference: 4.30; p-value: <.0001) and target therapy options showed the greatest improvement (mean difference: 3.65; p-value: <.0001), while knowledge of BRCA gene inheritance showed the smallest change (mean difference: 0.369; p-value: ns), suggesting some pre-existing awareness but limited understanding of its clinical applications. Overall, this pilot program demonstrates how pharmacy education can address healthcare disparities in rural communities. By preparing pharmacists to deliver accurate breast cancer education and to increase rural patient agency, this model creates a sustainable approach to improving health literacy in medically underserved areas. Future research could further expand this model to include diverse healthcare professionals and incorporate long-term impact assessments in community settings.

Individuals who self-report as Black or African American are historically underrepresented in genome-wide studies of disease risk, a disparity particularly evident in pediatric disease research. To address this gap, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) established a biorepository and developed a comprehensive DNA sequencing resource including 15,684 individuals who self-identified as African American or Black and received care at CCHMC. Participants were enrolled through the CCHMC Discover Together Biobank and sequenced. Admixture analyses confirmed the genetic ancestry of the cohort, which was then linked to electronic medical records. High-quality genome-wide genotypes from common variants accompanied by medical record-sourced data are available through the Genomic Information Commons. This dataset performs well in genetic studies. Specifically, we replicated known associations in sickle cell disease ( We present the acquisition and quality of genetic and disease-associated data and present an analytical framework for using this resource. In partnership with a community advisory council, we have co-developed a valuable framework for data use and future research.

Novel interventions are urgently needed to treat methamphetamine use disorder (MUD), for which there are no FDA-approved treatments. Previous studies in patients with MUD suggest transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L. dlPFC) decreases craving for methamphetamine. Theta burst stimulation (TBS), which includes intermittent TBS and continuous TBS (cTBS), is increasingly being used for substance use disorders, including MUD. Previous reviews of TMS in MUD performed sub-group meta-analyses of studies that delivered TBS in MUD. However, these meta-analyses included studies with overlapping participant cohorts. Given the absence of prior meta-analyses or reviews examining TBS in MUD using unique participant cohorts, we reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from three databases (PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Google Scholar) until September 1, 2024, comparing the impact of TBS versus sham TBS on cue-induced methamphetamine cravings in patients with MUD. We performed a meta-analysis with four eligible RCTs that delivered iTBS. Results suggest iTBS was more effective in reducing cue-induced methamphetamine cravings than sham iTBS (standardized mean difference [SMD] in change = 1.04; 95% CI [0.16, 1.92]). Our systematic review included two additional RCTs that did not have sham comparator arms; one of these demonstrated a significant reduction in methamphetamine craving with accelerated iTBS. Future studies should examine if iTBS can impact clinical outcome measures other than craving, such as methamphetamine use, by measuring return to drug use. It is also pertinent to explore accelerated iTBS and cTBS for MUD and study their effects on relevant biomarkers for MUD.

Total-evidence phylogenetic analysis resolves the evolutionary timescale of mantis shrimps (Stomatopoda) and provides insights into their molecular and morphological evolutionary rates.	The crustacean order Stomatopoda comprises approximately 500 species of mantis shrimps. These marine predators, common in tropical and subtropical waters, possess sophisticated visual systems and specialized hunting appendages. In this study, we infer the evolutionary relationships within Stomatopoda using a combined data set of 77 morphological characters, whole mitochondrial genomes, and three nuclear markers. Our data set includes representatives from all seven stomatopod superfamilies, including the first sequence data from Erythrosquilloidea. Using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock with fossil-based calibration priors, we estimate that crown-group unipeltatan stomatopods appeared ∼ 143 (95 % credible interval 199-98) million years ago in the Mesozoic. Additionally, our results support the hypothesis that specialized smashing and spearing appendages appeared early in the evolutionary history of Unipeltata. We found no evidence of a correlation between rates of morphological and molecular evolution across the phylogeny, but identified very high levels of among-lineage rate variation in the morphological characters. Our total-evidence analysis recovered evolutionary signals from both molecular and morphological data sets, demonstrating the merit in combining these sources of information for phylogenetic inference and evolutionary analysis.

For more than 15 years, undergraduate prelicensure students have designed, implemented, and evaluated an annual mass immunization clinic for the campus community. This exercise provides students with activities that promote public health leadership and management skills. In the fall of 2020 during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the campus community still anticipated the annual mass immunization clinic to continue. The annual mass immunization clinic was modified to meet all of the COVID-19 best practices recommendations. The clinic was moved outdoors to accommodate participants maintaining a distance of 6 feet. Although masks were required the clinic remained a gloveless procedure. Within an 8-hour time period, 2,870 flu vaccines were administered. This model proved to be effective in delivering the annual mass immunization clinic during a pandemic. Additionally, this model was used to help deliver the COVID-19 immunization when it became available.

Elevated waist-to-hip ratio, as an abdominal obesity index, predicts the risk of diabetic kidney injury.	Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is associated with a high incidence of type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) in Asia. Central obesity is an important risk factor for DN, represented by a series of indices, including waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), hip circumference, and visceral to subcutaneous fat area ratio (VSR). However, limited research has focused on the association between these indices and DN. To elucidate the relationship between central fat distribution, as measured by WHR and VSR, and the DN progression. Between August 2018 and April 2023, a total of 991 individuals were retrospectively recruited from the Rui'an People's Hospital for this cross-sectional analysis. The 753 individuals with T2DM were divided into three groups according to the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR): normal albuminuria ( Our results indicated that WHR and VSR were closely correlated with sex, ageing, body mass index, hypertension, T2DM causes, and experience of drinking and smoking, and potential relationships between these factors and DN progression were observed. WHR, but not VSR, gradually increased with the severity of early-stage renal injury. Abnormal serum lipid levels in T2DM patients with early-stage renal injury were strongly correlated with WHR. Logistic regression analysis revealed that WHR may be an independent risk factor for early-stage renal injury. In patients with T2DM, WHR level, rather than VSR level, is closely associated with early-stage renal injury. An abnormal serum lipid spectrum was common in all stages of renal injury and was strongly related to high WHR. Thus, WHR measurement might be a valuable tool for the early prevention of renal injury, which could guide clinical monitoring and prevent diabetic complications.

The CentiMarker project: Standardizing quantitative Alzheimer's disease fluid biomarkers for biologic interpretation.	Biomarkers play a crucial role in understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and treatment effects. However, comparing biomarker measures without standardization and appreciating their magnitude relative to the disease can be challenging. To address this issue, we propose the CentiMarker approach, similar to Centiloid, which provides a standardized scale between normal (0) and nearly maximum abnormal AD (100) ranges. We applied this scale to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in dominantly inherited AD and sporadic AD cohorts. CentiMarkers facilitated the interpretation of disease abnormality, demonstrating comparable changes and distributions of AD biomarkers across disease stages. CentiMarkers make the treatment effect more comparable than their original scales across various biomarkers. The versatility of CentiMarkers makes it a valuable tool for standardized biomarker comparison in AD research, enabling informed cross-study comparisons and contributing to accelerated therapeutic development. Adoption of the CentiMarker scale could enhance biomarker reporting and advance our understanding of AD. Comparing fluid biomarkers without appreciating their magnitude relative to the disease can be challenging. We propose a CentiMarker metric to standardize biomarker measures from normal (0) and nearly maximum abnormal AD (100) ranges. CentiMarkers make the treatment effect more comparable across various biomarkers than when using the original scales.	Alzheimer's disease; CentiMarker; biomarker standardization; fluid biomarker

Exploring the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in the management of early Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review of clinical evidence.	BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing neurodegenerative disorder causing cognitive decline, memory loss, and functional impairment. Lecanemab has shown safety and efficacy in clinical trials.ObjectiveThis review aims to understand the clinical evidence of lecanemab's effectiveness and safety in managing early AD.MethodsA systematic search was conducted using the Scopus database and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies from 2014 to 2024 on lecanemab's safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes for AD were included. Data extraction involved two independent reviewers, with synthesis using qualitative methodology.ResultsFindings from 13 studies and 13 ongoing clinical trials were reported, showing that lecanemab substantially reduces amyloid plaque load in the brains of AD patients. The therapeutic regimens vary across reported studies and trials, ranging from 2.5 mg/kg biweekly, 5 mg/kg monthly, 5 mg/kg biweekly, 10 mg/kg monthly, and 10 mg/kg intravenously biweekly. The Clarity AD phase 3 trial, the AHEAD study, and the DIAN-TU-001 trials have reported positive study outcomes with robust efficacy and safety outcomes with minimal side effects. Completed and ongoing trials report on the onset of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and the continuation of care status following the onset of ARIA in these patients. The common infusion-related reactions were observed in 26.4% of the lecanemab group compared to 7% in the placebo group.ConclusionsThe management of AD has evolved over the years with the introduction of novel therapeutic agents like lecanemab. While its safety profile is generally favorable, careful monitoring is essential.	Alzheimer's disease; BAN2401; amyloid-beta; lecanemab

Association Between High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Infection and Cervical Cytology in Health Check-Up Women - 23 PLADs, China, 2023.	Previous studies have documented the prevalence and distribution of human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection. However, there is limited current nationwide data on HPV distribution across different cytological conditions in recent years. This nationwide, cross-sectional study reveals that detection rates of HR-HPV infection and abnormal cytology among women undergoing health check-ups remain relatively high in China. Among women with abnormal cervical cytology, HPV-16 was the most prevalent HR-HPV genotype, followed by HPV-58 and HPV-52. These findings, based on a large population sample across China, provide critical insights into current cervical cancer screening outcomes and can inform the development of HPV genotype-specific vaccination and screening strategies to reduce cervical cancer burden.

EEG spectral analysis of nighttime sleep and daytime MSLTs and neurocognitive evaluations in subjects with co-morbid insomnia and OSA.	Chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea commonly co-occur. Few studies have explored the neurophysiological and neurocognitive characteristics of COMISA, which could help guide improving treatment diagnostic tools and determining novel therapeutic targets. This study aims to explore the neurophysiological and neurocognitive characteristics of COMISA using electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral analysis and subjective and objective neurocognitive measurements. Participants were from our community recruited OSA-insomnia-COMISA cohort with 206 included for our current analysis including 74 chronic insomniacs (CIs), 55 OSA patients and 77 COMISA patients. Standard polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs) were recorded and used to obtain relative EEG spectral power in each sleep stage during PSG and each session during MSLTs. A series of subjective and objective neurocognitive tests were conducted to evaluate executive function, attention, retrospective and prospective memory and meta-cognition. In PSG and MSLTs, COMISA patients showed combined EEG power characteristics of both CIs and OSA. Specifically, COMISA patients exhibited similar EEG spectral characteristics to CIs, with decreased delta and increased alpha and beta power in NREM sleep stages, and increased beta power in REM and MSLTs. Similar to the EEG spectral power profile of OSA, COMISA patients showed increased delta power in REM and MSLTs. Compared to OSA patients, COMISA patients exhibited worse subjectively measured attention and meta-cognition related to negative beliefs about uncontrollability and danger of worry (NEG), which were positively associated with ISI scores. The EEG spectral power characteristics of COMISA patients in overnight PSG and daytime MSLT appear to be the manifestation of elements of both CIs and OSA. However, the neurocognitive features of COMISA patients in subjectively measured attention and NEG meta-cognition were primarily affected by chronic insomnia.

Seltoplasmid promotes ulcer healing versus placebo for treating patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia: HOPE CLTI-2 trial.	Intramuscular injection of donaperminogene seltoplasmid (recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor plasmids) represents a gene therapy that treat patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). The HOPE CLTI-2 trial was a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of seltoplasmid in patients with Rutherford class 5 CLTI. This study did not require participants to be ineligible for revascularization, allowing enrollment of patients with CLTI caused by either atherosclerosis (ASO) or Buerger's disease (TAO). The primary endpoint was the complete ulcer healing rate at 6 months. A total of 242 participants (53.3% ASO versus 46.7% TAO) were enrolled, with 161 receiving seltoplasmid and 81 receiving placebo. Complete ulcer healing was achieved in 70 patients in the seltoplasmid group compared to 15 patients in the placebo group, resulting in an adjusted healing rate difference of 26.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.1-37.0%; P < 0.001). The hazard ratio for healing was 2.31 (95% CI: 1.32-4.05; P = 0.004). The benefits of seltoplasmid on ulcer healing persisted in both TAO and ASO subgroups. Serious adverse events were rare. Our study demonstrated that seltoplasmid significantly improved ulcer healing rates in patients with Rutherford class 5 CLTI compared to placebo.

Pan-cancer analysis of ITGB3 as a potential prognostic and immunological biomarker.	Integrin β3 (ITGB3) acts as a crucial regulator and target within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and is highly expressed in the TIME of various tumors. The TIMER, TCGA, GTEx, and CCLE databases were utilized to comprehensively analyze the differential expression of ITGB3 in tumor tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis, forest plots, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to assess the genetic alterations, clinicopathological characteristics, and prognostic value of ITGB3. Additionally, the R software package was used to evaluate the relationship between ITGB3 expression and immune cell infiltration, immunomodulatory genes, and immune checkpoints, and potential signaling pathways were examined through differential expression and enrichment analysis. We found that the high expression of ITGB3 is a significant risk factor for six types of cancer, including adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), and is closely associated with a lower survival rate. Anti-tumor immune cells (CD8 + T cells, CD4 + Th1 cells, and NKT cells) were significantly reduced. By contrast, pro-tumor immune cells (Tregs and CD4 + Th2 cells), immune checkpoints (CTLA4 and PD-CD1), and negatively regulated co-stimulators of T-cell activation (CTLA4, PD-CD1, and IL10) were significantly elevated in most types of cancer with high ITGB3 expression. Overall, our preliminary results indicate that ITGB3 plays an important role in immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Elevated levels of ITGB3 inhibit tumor immunity, facilitate tumor immune escape, and affect patient prognosis, and it may be a prognostic biomarker.

Association of Body Mass Index in Late Life, and Change from Midlife to Late Life, With Incident Dementia in the ARIC Study Participants.	Midlife obesity is a risk factor of dementia, but late-life obesity has been associated with lower dementia risk. We investigated this paradox by exploring the relationship between late-life body mass index (BMI) category and dementia, with and without considering midlife to late-life BMI change. This observational cohort study included participants of the community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study who were dementia-free at visit 5 (2011-2013). Dementia was ascertained by expert-adjudicated, algorithmic classification from an in-person neuropsychological battery, as well as telephone interviews and International Classification of Diseases codes from medical records. We first assessed the association of incident dementia with visit 5 BMI categories (normal weight, overweight, obese). Next, we used a cross-classification of visit 5 BMI categories with visit 4-visit 5 BMI change (decrease [loss of ≥2 kg/m A total of 5,129 participants were included in the study (59% female; 22% identified as Black; mean (standard deviation) age at visit 5 of 75 (5) years). Over 8 years of follow-up, 20% of the sample developed dementia (n = 1,026). After covariate adjustment, participants with high late-life BMI had a lower risk of dementia; the hazard ratio (95% CI) was 0.86 (0.73-1.00) for overweight and 0.81 (0.68-0.96) for obesity. In stratified models, elevated dementia risk was observed only for participants of each late-life BMI category whose BMI had decreased from midlife to late life. Compared with normal-weight individuals who had maintained BMI from midlife to late life, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for those with BMI loss was 2.08 (1.62-2.67) for normal-weight individuals, 1.62 (1.25-2.10) for those with overweight, and 1.36 (1.00-1.85) for those with obesity. Our results provide insight into the dementia obesity paradox at older ages, tempering a causal interpretation of high late-life BMI as protective against dementia. Instead, they highlight the importance of considering weight loss from midlife to late life in conjunction with late-life BMI in dementia risk stratification.

Isolation and characterization of extracellular vesicles from EGFR mutated lung cancer cells.	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is essential for cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, and migration. Dysregulation of EGFR signaling is frequently observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is associated with poor prognosis. This study aims to isolate and characterize extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by mutant EGFR lung cancer cell line PC9 and compare them with wild-type EGFR lung cancer cell line A549, while also evaluating the effect of gefitinib treatment on EV secretion and cargo composition. The two lung cancer cell lines were cultured with 2% EV-free serum, and EVs were subsequently isolated by differential ultra centrifugation. EVs were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for quantification size and shape determination. Western blot analysis confirmed the enrichment and purity of isolated EVs. Results showed that EGFR mutation significantly increased EV release and altered their size, compared to EVs released by wild-type EGFR cells. In addition to classical EV markers such as CD81, Flotillin- 1, and TSG101, Western blot analysis also detected phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR) selectively packaged into EVs from PC9 cells. Gefitinib treatment significantly reduced EV secretion in PC9 cells and led to a marked decrease in p-EGFR incorporation into EVs, indicating that EV biogenesis and compostion are modulated by active EGFR signaling. In conclusion, this study highlights the significant influence of EGFR activation on EV secretion and cargo composition while demonstrating that EGFR inhibition via gefitinib alters EV-mediated signaling in lung cancer cells. These findings provide insights into tumor behavior, EV-mediated oncogenic communication, and the potential use of EVs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in NSCLC.

Early increase of the synaptic blood marker β-synuclein in asymptomatic autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.	β-synuclein is a promising blood marker to track synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but changes in preclinical AD are unclear. We investigated serum β-synuclein in 69 cognitively unimpaired mutation non-carriers, 78 cognitively unimpaired AD mutation carriers (asymptomatic AD), and 31 symptomatic mutation carriers from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network. β-synuclein levels were already higher in asymptomatic AD mutation carriers compared to non-carriers and highest in symptomatic carriers. Longitudinal trajectories and correlation analyses indicated that β-synuclein levels start to rise after amyloid deposition preceding axonal degeneration, brain atrophy and hypometabolism, and cognitive decline. β-synuclein levels were associated with cognitive impairment and gradually increased with declining cognition. Our study supports the use of blood β-synuclein to track synaptic changes in preclinical AD and as a surrogate marker for cognitive impairment which might be used in early diagnosis and to support patient selection and monitoring of treatment effects in clinical trials. Blood β-synuclein levels were already higher in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutation carriers. Blood β-synuclein levels were highest in symptomatic AD mutation carriers. Blood β-synuclein levels start to rise 11 years before symptom onset. Rise of β-synuclein precedes axonal degeneration, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline. β-synuclein levels gradually increased with declining cognition.	asymptomatic mutation carriers; autosomal dominant Alzheimer´s disease; blood biomarker; preclinical Alzheimer´s disease; synaptic degeneration; β‐synuclein

CXCL12 alone is enough to Reprogram Normal Fibroblasts into Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts.	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are critical components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), playing significant roles in regulating cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanism of CAFs activation remains elusive. In this study, we aim to investigates the mechanisms by which CAFs promote the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to CAFs in lung cancer, with a focus on the role of p53 mutations and the CXCL12/STAT3 signaling axis. We found that CAFs significantly induced NFs to acquire CAFs properties (called CEFs), including upregulation of α-SMA and Vimentin, enhanced proliferation and migration, and increased ability to promote lung cancer cell migration. In vivo, CEFs accelerated A549 xenograft growth and induced spontaneous lung metastasis. CXCL12 was identified as a key factor in NFs-to-CEFs conversion, with its expression positively correlated with CAFs markers in lung cancer. Further investigation confirmed that CXCL12 is sufficient to reprogram NFs into CAFs through the STAT3 pathway. Notably, inhibiting CXCL12 signaling and the STAT3 pathway reduced the conversion of NFs to CAFs, thereby hindering lung cancer progression progression both in vitro and in vivo. Our study reveals CAFs could promote the conversion of NFs to CAFs-like cells through the CXCL12/STAT3 axis, enhancing tumor growth and metastasis in lung cancer. Therefore, inhibition of the CXCL12/STAT3 axis is a promising strategy for the treatment of lung cancers and other CXCL12-dependent malignancies.

Longitudinal Evolution of Posterior Cortical Atrophy: Diagnostic Delays, Overlapping Phenotypes, and Clinical Outcomes.	Although several large studies have evaluated individuals with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) cross-sectionally, its longitudinal progression remains poorly characterized. The objectives of this study were to determine the longitudinal trajectory of PCA, encompassing the temporal aspects of diagnosis, the spectrum of clinical manifestations, and patient outcomes. This retrospective study included participants evaluated and diagnosed with PCA at the Mayo Clinic, between 1995 and 2023. Clinical data (demographics, neurologic evaluations, and cognitive tests at initial presentation and late stage) were extracted from medical records. Initial clinical diagnoses during previous medical evaluations, including ophthalmologic assessments after onset of neurologic symptoms, were documented. Participants were retrospectively classified as PCA-pure if they solely met PCA criteria or as PCA-plus if they exhibited complex phenotypes also meeting criteria for other neurodegenerative syndromes. CSF analyses and neuropathology findings were documented. The cohort of 558 participants (65% female) had a mean age at symptom onset of 61 ± 8 years, with 68% meeting early-onset criteria (younger than 65 years). The mean duration from symptom onset to diagnosis was 3.6 ± 2.5 years. Ophthalmologic/optometric evaluations (49%) and completion of ophthalmologic procedures (16%) were common before PCA diagnosis. Psychiatric diagnoses were made in 23% of participants before PCA diagnosis, particularly among younger women. Common initial symptoms included misplacement of items, difficulties with reading and driving, and concerns pertaining to basic visual processing. Notable signs were constructional apraxia, dyscalculia, simultanagnosia, and space perception deficits. CSF biomarkers were consistent with Alzheimer disease in 139 of 158 individuals (88%). Superimposed features of non-PCA clinical syndromes were observed in a quarter of the participants at presentation, with frequency of PCA-plus cases increasing longitudinally. Longitudinal analysis of Short Test of Mental Status scores predicted an initial rapid decline in cognitive function, with the rate of decline gradually slowing over 0-10 years (time coefficient [SE] = -4.20 [0.29], This study highlights the protracted time from symptom onset and frequent misdiagnoses/misattribution of symptoms in PCA. Ophthalmologic evaluations often preceded neurologic assessments. Psychiatric diagnoses were more frequent among younger women. These observations highlight the need to improve diagnostic processes and earlier recognition of PCA, which may enhance the effectiveness of emerging disease-modifying therapies.

Predicting Regional Lymph Node Metastases at CT in Microsatellite Instability-High Colon Cancer.	Background Early identification of lymph node metastasis is crucial for microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colon cancer caused by deficient mismatch repair, but accuracy of CT is poor. Purpose To determine whether CT-detected lymph node distribution patterns can improve lymph node evaluation in MSI-H colon cancer. Materials and Methods This two-center retrospective study included patients with MSI-H colon cancer who underwent pretreatment CT and radical surgery (development set, December 2017-December 2022; test set, January 2016-January 2024). Lymph node characteristics associated with pathologic lymph node metastasis (pN+), including clinical lymph node stage (cN) and distribution patterns (vascular distribution, jammed cluster, and partial fusion), were selected (logistic regression and Kendall tau-b correlation) to create a distribution-based clinical lymph node stage (dcN) in the development set. Diagnostic performance was verified in the test set. Interobserver agreement was assessed by using Fleiss κ. Clinical value of dcN was assessed using univariable logistic analysis among patients in the treatment set receiving neoadjuvant immunotherapy (August 2017-February 2024). Results The study included 368 patients (median age, 60 years [IQR, 50-70 years]; 211 male): 230 from the development set (median age, 59 years [IQR, 49-70 years]), 86 from the test set (median age, 66 years [IQR, 55-79 years]), and 52 from the treatment set (median age, 54 years [IQR, 42-65 years]). Only jammed cluster and partial fusion were associated with higher odds of pN+ (odds ratio, 78.9 and 21.5, respectively; both

Jaceosidin overcomes osimertinib resistance in lung cancer by inducing G2/M cycle arrest through targeting DDB1.	Osimertinib is a third-generation Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) widely used to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations. However, resistance to osimertinib frequently develops, limiting its long-term effectiveness. This study aimed to establish a lung cancer TKI-resistant model and identify Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) components that could reverse TKI resistance, enhancing lung cancer sensitivity to targeted therapies, while exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms. Osimertinib-resistant cell lines and organoids were developed using a dose-escalation approach. A screen of 302 traditional Chinese medicine monomers revealed compounds that increased sensitivity to osimertinib. RNA sequencing and limited proteolysis coupled with small molecule mapping were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which jaceosidin reverses resistance. The efficacy of the jaceosidin and osimertinib combination was confirmed in cell lines, organoids, and a mouse model. The osimertinib-resistant lung cancer model was successfully established, and 12 compounds were identified that enhanced the sensitivity of resistant cells to osimertinib. Among these, Jaceosidin, a flavonoid compound derived from Eupatorium lindleyanum DC., was confirmed to notably increase osimertinib sensitivity. Mechanistic studies, including limited proteolysis and RNA interference analysis, demonstrated that Jaceosidin directly interacts with Damage Specific DNA Binding Protein 1 (DDB1), promoting its protein expression and downregulating CDK1/Cyclin B1 levels. This interaction induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, thereby sensitizing lung cancer cells to osimertinib. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that the combination of Jaceosidin and osimertinib significantly inhibited tumor growth in osimertinib-resistant models. These findings offer new insights into the role of DDB1 in overcoming osimertinib resistance and suggest that combining jaceosidin with osimertinib may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs treatment in resistant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

Gallie technique in the treatment of odontoid fracture in pediatric: A case report.	Pediatric cervical spine injuries (CSI) account for 60-80 % of all pediatric spine injuries and remains a challenge due to the difference in spinal anatomy compared to adults. There are currently no standardized method of diagnosis and treatment for CSI in children, hence identification and management remain challenging for orthopaedic surgeons. a 11-year-old girl present with weakness on right upper and lower limb due to hyperflexion injury after her father accidentally fell on her neck. Initial radiology workup showed normal bony alignments and led to the misdiagnosis of Guillain-Barre Syndrome. However, further CT and MRI workup revealed odontoid fracture compromising the spinal canal, which caused anterior cord syndrome. She was managed by Modified Gallie procedure, which involves passing a sublaminar wire in C1-C2 and using the resected part of C2 from the subsequent decompression as an onlay type graft. Her condition was stable post-operatively and 3-months follow up showed improved motor and sensory function in ASIA Score. Patient had even returned to school and regained mobilization using a walker. Upper cervical injuries in younger patients are common due to their anatomy and flexibility allowing immediate self-reduction post dislocation, which may cause the initial normal radiography. Modified Gallie procedure and decompression was selected as the treatment to alleviate the need of additional bone graft. Cervical spine injury in children is a rare but challenging entity, where successful management requires an understanding of pediatric anatomical differences and the specific patterns of pathologies that frequently occur.

Circadian rhythm disruption promotes M1 macrophages polarization exacerbating the inflammatory response in rosacea.	To explore the role of macrophage polarization induced by circadian rhythm disorder (CRD) in the aggravated inflammatory response of rosacea. The rosacesis-like animal model was established by intradermal injection of Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL-37 (LL37) into the back of mice. HE staining, Western blot and immunofluorescence detection were used to investigate the effect of circadian rhythm disorder on the expression of inflammatory factors and macrophage polarization in rosacea. Overexpression of Brain and Muscle ARNT-Like 1 (Oe-Bmal1) was transfected into HaCaT cells and M0 macrophages treated with LL37 in vitro to investigate the role of Muscle ARNT-Like 1 (Bmal1) on rosacea. In LL37-induced rosacea mice, circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) suppressed the expression of circadian clock proteins, including Bmal1, Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (Clock), Period Circadian Protein 1 (Per1), Period Circadian Protein 2 (Per2), Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1 (Rev-erbα), and Retinoic Acid Receptor-Related Orphan Receptor Alpha (RORα), and induced the polarization of macrophages in rosacea-like mice towards the M1 phenotype. Subsequently, the expression of inflammatory factors, including Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), was promoted, which aggravated the inflammatory response of skin lesions. Over-expression of Bmal1 significantly increased the expression level of clock proteins and inhibited the polarization of macrophages to M1 type, consequently inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors in the cell model of rosacea. Circadian rhythm disorder may aggravate the inflammatory response of rosacea by affecting macrophage polarization, which indicates that paying attention to regular sleep and rest may be necessary for the treatment and management of rosacea.

Appropriate Use Recommendations (AUR) were developed to guide the implementation of donanemab in real-world practice, prioritizing safety considerations and opportunity for effectiveness. The AUR were developed by the AD and Related Disorders Therapeutic Workgroup by consensus, integrating available data and expert opinion. Appropriate candidates for donanemab treatment include persons with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD (Clinical Stages 3-4, MMSE 20-30) who have biomarker confirmation of AD pathology by PET or CSF. Tau PET is not required for eligibility. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping should be performed prior to treatment to inform an individual's risk of developing Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA). Pre-treatment MRI should be obtained no more than 12 months prior to treatment. Patients with findings of >4 cerebral microbleeds, cortical superficial siderosis or a major vascular contribution to cognitive impairment should be excluded from treatment. The decision to initiate therapy should be grounded in a shared decision-making process that emphasizes the patient's values and goals of care. Donanemab is administered as a monthly intravenous infusion. Surveillance MRIs to evaluate for ARIA should be performed prior to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 7th infusions, prior to the 12th dose in higher risk individuals, and at any time ARIA is suspected clinically. Clinicians may consider discontinuing treatment if amyloid clearance is demonstrated by amyloid PET, typically obtained 12-18 months after initiating treatment.

Supplementation with Lentinan Improves the Colostrum Quality of Holstein Dairy Cows and the Immunity and Antioxidant Capacity of Newborn Calves.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lentinan (LNT) on the quality of colostrum produced by perinatal dairy cows and the health status of their newborn calves. A total of 40 expectant Holstein cows, matched for parity and expected date of delivery, were selected and randomly divided into four groups: a control group fed a total mixed diet (TMR); a low LNT group (10 g/d, LLNT); a medium LNT group (20 g/d, MLNT); and a high LNT group (40 g/d, HLNT). The study commenced 21 days prior to parturition and continued for three weeks. Colostrum was collected from the cows immediately after delivery and subsequently fed to the newborn calves. The results indicated that colostrum milk protein production and IgG production in the MLNT group were significantly increased (	colostrum; lentinan; newborn calves; transfer passive immunity

Controlled release of deferiprone using iron-responsive nanoparticles integrated with dissolving microneedle for novel alternative treatments of β-thalassemia major.	Iron chelating agents (ICs) such as conventional deferiprone are often ineffective when exposed to normal conditions due to their uncontrolled release when treating iron overload in ß-thalassemia major (ß-TM) due to the effects of blood transfusion. Iron deficiency and gastrointestinal side effects are crucial problems that can occur. Therefore, DFP was prepared as nanoparticles (NPs) coated with an iron-responsive (IR) polymer with an average particle size of 354.70 ± 10 nm to control its release. To facilitate optimal delivery, NP-IR-DFP was integrated into a dissolving microneedle (DMN) fabricated with biodegradable and biocompatible poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and poly(vinyl alcohol) polymers. The results showed that the NP-IR-DMN provided excellent insertion and mechanical strength and dissolved quickly after application. In vitro and ex-vivo studies revealed the more controllable release of NP-IR-DFP after integration with the DMN (NP-IR-DMN) for up to 24 h. Most importantly, the developed formula was hemocompatible and did not irritate the skin or cause tissue damage. Furthermore, the in vivo pharmacokinetics were further investigated for 24 h, which revealed short concentration (C	Deferiprone; Dissolving microneedle; Iron overload; Iron-responsive; Nanoparticle; ß-Thalassemia major

Candidate target genes in sepsis diagnosis and therapy: identifying hub genes with a spotlight on KLRB1.	Sepsis, which causes systemic inflammation and organ failure, is one of the leading causes of death in the intensive care unit (ICU) and an urgent social health problem. However, the pathogenesis and molecular mechanism of sepsis are unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to identify candidate Hub genes during sepsis progression and the candidate target genes for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. GSE54514, GSE57065, GSE69528, GSE95233, and GSE131761 datasets were downloaded from public databases, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy and septic patients in each dataset were screened at adjusted P-value < 0.05 and| log2FC| ≥ 0.58. Subsequently, the obtained DEGs in each dataset were intersected to obtain the Hub genes. In addition, the DEGs between patients with better and poor prognoses in datasets GSE54514 and GSE95233 were analyzed after 28 days. The differential expression of Hub genes in septic patients with good and poor prognoses was detected at adjusted P-value < 0.05 and| log2FC| ≥ 0.58. Finally, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the bioinformatics results. In datasets GSE54514, GSE57065, GSE69528, GSE95233 and GSE131761, RNASE2, RNASE3, CTSG, SLPI, TNFAIP6, PGLYRP1 and BLOC1S1 were up-regulated in septic patients, and RPL10A and KLRB1 were down-regulated compared to healthy controls. qRT-PCR confirmed the expression trend of the hub genes except CTSG (which was not differentially expressed). Compared to septic patients with good prognoses, the differential expression of RNASE3 was higher in patients with poor prognoses. Furthermore, qRT-PCR revealed that KLRB1 was the only differentially expressed hub gene with down-regulated expression in sepsis patients with poor prognosis. The candidate Hub genes closely related to sepsis include KLRB1, RNASE2, RNASE3, CTSG, SLPI, TNFAIP6, PGLYRP1, BLOC1S1, and RPL10A. KLRB1 is the most relevant candidate hub gene among these hub genes in the molecular underpinnings of sepsis, which could be targeted for sepsis detection and treatment.

Genome-wide identification of the AAT gene family in quinoa and analysis of its expression pattern under abiotic stresses.	Plant amino acid transporters play an important role in the absorption of soil amino acids by roots, the transport of amino acids between xylem and phloem, plant growth and development, and response to abiotic stress. In this study, we identified 147 AAT genes in the quinoa genome sequence and categorized them into 12 subfamilies on the basis of their similarity and phylogenetic relationships with AAT found in Arabidopsis thaliana. Interestingly, these AAT genes are not evenly distributed on the quinoa chromosomes. Instead, most of these genes are centrally located on the outer edges of the chromosome arms. After performing motif analysis and gene structure analysis, we observed the consistent presence of similar motifs and intron-exon distribution patterns among subfamilies. Tissue expression analysis revealed that CqAAT gene was less expressed in fruits and more expressed in roots, stems, leaves and flowers. Meanwhile, expression analysis under four adversities of high temperature, low temperature, waterlogging, and drought and different treatments of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash fertilizers found that two genes of the CqGAT subfamily, AUR62031750 and AUR62023955 were up-regulated expressed under abiotic stresses. In summary, there is a significant differentiation in the tissue expression and stress expression of the CqAAT gene, indicating that CqAATs play a role in regulating growth and development under abiotic stress.

Design, Synthesis, Antibacterial Activity, and Mechanism of Action of Coumarin Derivatives Containing Benzylamine.	A series of novel coumarin derivatives were synthesized by successfully combining the coumarin backbone with benzylamine groups using active splicing technology and chemical synthesis. These derivatives demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity in vitro, with compound A5 being particularly prominent. Through three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationships (3D-QSAR) analysis, it was found that the introduction of an electron-donating group at the R1 position and a larger group at the R2 position could enhance the antibacterial activity, and the action mechanism of compound A5 was studied. The experimental results showed that A5 could increase the permeability of the bacterial membrane, thus disrupting the Xoo membrane and effectively inhibiting bacterial growth. This finding not only reveals the antibacterial mechanism of A5, but also provides an important scientific basis for the development of new antibacterial agents.	antibacterial activity; changes in cell morphology; coumarin derivatives

Escitalopram for agitation in Alzheimer's dementia: a randomized controlled phase 3 trial.	Citalopram is effective in treating agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AD), but it is associated with cognitive and cardiac risks, likely due to its R-enantiomer. Escitalopram, the S-enantiomer, may be an alternative. In this double-masked randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in treating agitation in AD after failure of a psychosocial intervention (PSI). Assessments occurred at enrollment, post-PSI (baseline) and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks post-baseline. Settings were 27 community-based centers. The target randomization sample was 392 participants. Participants were adults with AD, a Mini-Mental State Examination Telephone score of 3-20 and significant agitation. PSI non-responders received escitalopram (up to 15 mg per day) or placebo for 12 weeks while continuing PSI. The outcome was the proportion of participants with clinically significant improvement in agitation from baseline at 12 weeks. In total, 173 participants were randomized (84 escitalopram versus 89 placebo; mean ± s.d. age = 78.4 ± 8.7 years; 90 men (52.0%); 127 White (73.4%)). The unadjusted risk difference at 12 weeks was 0.08 (95% confidence interval: -0.21, 0.06). Drug-related QT interval prolongation was observed. Although the randomized sample was smaller than planned, escitalopram was not effective in treating agitation in AD and was associated with cardiac conduction delays. Clinicians need to be cautious in recommending escitalopram as an alternative to citalopram for this condition. ClincialTrials.gov identifier: NCT03108846 .

SC-VAR: a computational tool for interpreting polygenic disease risks using single-cell epigenomic data.	One major challenge of interpreting variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits or diseases is how to efficiently annotate noncoding variants. These variants influence gene expression by disrupting cis-regulatory elements (CREs), whose spatial and cell-type specificity are not adequately captured by conventional tools like multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation. Current methods either rely on linear proximity to genes or quantitative trait locus (QTL) data yet fail to integrate single-cell epigenomic information for a comprehensive annotation. We present SC-VAR, a novel computational tool designed to enhance the interpretation of disease-associated risks from GWAS using single-cell epigenomic data. SC-VAR leverages single-cell epigenomic data to predict functional outcomes including risk genes, pathways, and cell types for both coding and noncoding disease-associated variants. We demonstrate that SC-VAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by predicting more validated disease-related genes and pathways for multiple diseases. Additionally, SC-VAR identifies cell types that are susceptible to disease, along with their specific CREs and target genes linked to risk. By capturing a broad range of disease risks across human tissues at distinct developmental stages, SC-VAR could enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms in complex tissues across different life stages.	disease relevance score; genome-wide association studies (GWAS); noncoding variant annotation; polygenic disease risks; single-cell epigenomics

Safety and efficacy of long-term gantenerumab treatment in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease: an open-label extension of the phase 2/3 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled platform DIAN-TU trial.	Amyloid plaque removal by monoclonal antibody therapies slows clinical progression in symptomatic Alzheimer's disease; however, the potential for delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in asymptomatic people is unknown. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) is an ongoing platform trial assessing the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational products in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). Based on findings of amyloid removal and downstream biological effects from the gantenerumab group of the platform trial, we continued a 3-year open-label extension (OLE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with high doses of gantenerumab. The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 multi-arm trial (DIAN-TU-001) assessed solanezumab or gantenerumab versus placebo in participants who were between 15 years before and 10 years after their estimated years to symptom onset and who had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0 (cognitively normal) to 1 (mild dementia). This study was followed by an OLE study of gantenerumab treatment, conducted at 18 study sites in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Spain, the UK, and the USA. For inclusion in the OLE, participants at risk for DIAD had participated in the double-blind period of DIAN-TU-001 and were required to know their mutation status. We investigated increasing doses of subcutaneous gantenerumab up to 1500 mg every 2 weeks. Due to the lack of a regulatory path for gantenerumab, the study was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis (when most participants had completed 2 years of treatment) of the clinical measure CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). The primary outcome for the final analysis was the amyloid plaque measure Of 74 participants who were recruited into the OLE study between June 3, 2020, and April 22, 2021, 73 were enrolled and received gantenerumab treatment. 47 (64%) stopped dosing due to early termination of the study by the sponsor, and 13 (18%) prematurely discontinued the study for other reasons; 13 people completed 3 years of treatment. The mITT group for the primary analysis comprised 55 participants. At the interim analysis, the hazard ratio for clinical decline of CDR-SB in asymptomatic mutation carriers was 0·79 (n=53 [95% CI 0·47 to 1·32]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab in either the double-blind or OLE period (Any Gant), and 0·53 (n=22 [0·27 to 1·03]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab the longest (Longest Gant). At the final analysis, the adjusted mean change from OLE baseline to year 3 in PiB-PET SUVR was -0·71 SUVR (95% CI -0·88 to -0·53, p<0·0001). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities occurred in 53% (39 of 73) of participants: 47% (34 of 73) with microhaemorrhages, 30% (22 of 73) with oedema, and 6% (five of 73) were associated with superficial siderosis. No treatment-associated macrohaemorrhages or deaths occurred. Partial or short-term amyloid removal did not show significant clinical effects. However, long-term full amyloid removal potentially delayed symptom onset and dementia progression. Our conclusions are limited due to the OLE design and use of external controls and need to be confirmed in long-term trials.

Sample size estimates for biomarker-based outcome measures in clinical trials in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer disease (AD)-modifying therapies are approved for treatment of early-symptomatic AD. Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) provides a unique opportunity to test therapies in presymptomatic individuals. Using data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), sample sizes for clinical trials were estimated for various cognitive, imaging, and CSF outcomes. Sample sizes were computed for detecting a reduction of either absolute levels of AD-related pathology (amyloid, tau) or change over time in neurodegeneration (atrophy, hypometabolism, cognitive change). Biomarkers measuring amyloid and tau pathology had required sample sizes below 200 participants per arm (examples CSF Aβ42/40: 47[95 %CI 25,104], cortical PIB 49[28,99], CSF p-tau181 74[48,125]) for a four-year trial in presymptomatic individuals (CDR=0) to have 80 % power (5 % statistical significance) to detect a 25 % reduction in absolute levels of pathology, allowing 40 % dropout. For cognitive, MRI, and FDG, it was more appropriate to detect a 50 % reduction in rate of change. Sample sizes ranged from 250 to 900 (examples hippocampal volume: 338[131,2096], cognitive composite: 326[157,1074]). MRI, FDG and cognitive outcomes had lower sample sizes when including indivduals with mild impairment (CDR=0.5 and 1) as well as presymptomatic individuals (CDR=0). Despite the rarity of ADAD, presymptomatic clinical trials with feasible sample sizes given the number of cases appear possible.

Heterogeneous piezo-self-Fenton material design: an intersecting solution for pollutant degradation and tumor therapy.	Heterogeneous piezo-self-Fenton (EPSF), an integration of piezocatalysis and heterogeneous Fenton reactions, forms the foundation for efficient redox interfacial reactions in complex environments. The significant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the catalytic process and the mechanical energy-driven nature of the EPSF process provide distinct advantages in environmental remediation and biomedical applications. Numerous studies on EPSF catalysts have emerged in recent years across these fields. However, the construction approaches and design strategies for EPSF catalysts in various application scenarios remain unclear. This review synthesizes and analyzes studies on organic pollutant degradation and targeted tumor therapy. Based on the elucidation of redox processes in EPSF catalysis, the catalysts are categorized according to structural features, clarifying common material systems across different fields. The factors influencing EPSF catalytic performance are subsequently outlined, followed by an evaluation of corresponding enhancement strategies. Finally, design strategies for EPSF catalysts across applications are analyzed, emphasizing the commonalities and distinctions in catalyst design for different fields. Insights are provided to inform future catalyst development.

Comorbid cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors (CVM) differentially impact brain structure and increase dementia risk, but their specific magnetic resonance imaging signatures (MRI) remain poorly characterized. To address this, we developed and validated machine learning models to quantify the distinct spatial patterns of atrophy and white matter hyperintensities related to hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, and type-2 diabetes mellitus at the patient level. Using harmonized MRI data from 37,096 participants (45-85 years) in a large multinational dataset of 10 cohort studies, we generated five in silico severity markers that: i) outperformed conventional structural MRI markers with a ten-fold increase in effect sizes, ii) captured subtle patterns at sub-clinical CVM stages, iii) were most sensitive in mid-life (45-64 years), iv) were associated with brain beta-amyloid status, and v) showed stronger associations with cognitive performance than diagnostic CVM status. Integrating personalized measurements of CVM-specific brain signatures into phenotypic frameworks could guide early risk detection and stratification in clinical studies.

Carbon NMR Titration Could Be More Informative for In-Situ Lanthanide Coordination Chemistry Investigation.	In situ characterization of coordination species and their evolution are crucial for effective lanthanide separation and recycling. Current technical approaches often operate under constrained conditions, requiring complex equipment, experimental setups, and sometimes intricate data interpretation. Herein, we demonstrate that carbon NMR titrations offer a valuable approach for in situ coordination analysis of lanthanides, particularly for highly fused preorganized ligands that offer more NMR-active carbons than traditional proton NMR. Two representative ligands of both lipophilic and hydrophilic in nature were investigated, and the resulting carbon NMR titration data were analyzed. Comparisons with IR and single-crystal data showed that NMR provided insights not only into the evolution of coordination species but also into changes in the electron distribution during complex formation. Additionally, we discussed inconsistencies between atomic charge populations obtained from carbon NMR and those from Mulliken and Hirshfeld calculations. With advancements in NMR technology and the availability of higher-field NMR instruments, we believe NMR titrations will play an increasingly significant role in unravelling the complex solution coordination chemistry of f-block elements.

Exploring the impact of gut microbiota-mediated regulation of exosomal miRNAs from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells on the regulation of bone metabolism.	Osteoporosis, which is a prevalent metabolic bone disease, is closely associated with imbalances in the gut microbiota. The ovaries of female 6-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats were surgically removed to induce osteoporosis. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing was employed to characterize the gut microbiota in the osteoporotic rats. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated from osteoporotic rats and cultured separately, and their osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation was observed. Furthermore, exosomes were extracted from these cells, and miRNA sequencing was performed on the exosomes to identify key miRNAs. Osteoporotic rats were then treated with a member of the gut microbiota, and changes in the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs were observed. In our investigation, we observed altered proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the guts of ovariectomized rats, which contributed to dysbiosis and subsequent changes in intestinal permeability. The BMSCs exhibited disrupted osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation, which was associated with structural damage to bones. Through the isolation of exosomes from BMSCs and subsequent miRNA analysis, we identified miR-151-3p and miR-23b-3p as potential pivotal regulators of bone metabolism. Furthermore, through 16S rRNA sequencing, we identified g_Ruminococcus and its marked capacity to ameliorate the imbalance in BMSC osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation. Intervention with g_Ruminococcus demonstrated promising outcomes, mitigating bone loss and structural damage to the tibia and femur in ovariectomized rats. These findings highlight the significant role of g_Ruminococcus in alleviating osteoporosis induced by estrogen deficiency, suggesting its therapeutic potential for addressing postmenopausal osteoporosis through the targeted modulation of BMSC-derived exosomal miR-151-3p and miR-23b-3p.

Association between the triglyceride glucose index and the risk of acute respiratory failure in patients with acute pancreatitis.	The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index serves as a dependable marker for insulin resistance and has shown a significant correlation with the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP). However, no research exists regarding the association between the TyG index and the development of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in AP. This study assesses the association between TyG index and ARF in patients with AP. Retrospective cohort analysis was conducted with the MIMIC-IV 2.2 critical care data. The endpoint focused on ARF during hospitalization. Statistical analysis encompassed univariate and multivariate logistic regressions, alongside restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis to explore potential nonlinear associations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed to identify the optimal TyG index cutoff, leading to the classification of patients into Low TyG and High TyG groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were subsequently applied to minimize the influence of confounding factors, thereby further clarifying the relationship between the TyG index and ARF in patients with AP. A total of 758 patients were involved in this study, the incidence of ARF was 21.64%. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated a significant association between the TyG index and the incidence of ARF in patients with AP. The RCS model illustrated a nonlinear relationship between a higher TyG index and an increased risk of ARF. The cutoff value of TyG index was 9.099 for ARF in patients with AP based on the ROC curve analysis. Furthermore, following PSM and IPTW, multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the High TyG group exhibited a significantly higher risk of ARF compared to the Low TyG group (P < 0.05). The TyG index is associated with ARF risk in AP patients and may aid in early risk assessment.

Chimpanzees (	Ongoing ecosystem change and biodiversity decline across the Afrotropics call for tools to monitor the state of biodiversity or ecosystem elements across extensive spatial and temporal scales. We assessed relationships in the co-occurrence patterns between great apes and other medium to large-bodied mammals to evaluate whether ape abundance serves as a proxy for mammal diversity across broad spatial scales. We used camera trap footage recorded at 22 research sites, each known to harbor a population of chimpanzees, and some additionally a population of gorillas, across 12 sub-Saharan African countries. From ~350,000 1-min camera trap videos recorded between 2010 and 2016, we estimated mammalian community metrics, including species richness, Shannon diversity, and mean animal mass. We then fitted Bayesian Regression Models to assess potential relationships between ape detection rates (as proxy for ape abundance) and these metrics. We included site-level protection status, human footprint, and precipitation variance as control variables. We found that relationships between detection rates of great apes and other mammal species, as well as animal mass were largely positive. In contrast, relationships between ape detection rate and mammal species richness were less clear and differed according to site protection and human impact context. We found no clear association between ape detection rate and mammal diversity. Our findings suggest that chimpanzees hold potential as indicators of specific elements of mammalian communities, especially population-level and composition-related characteristics. Declines in chimpanzee populations may indicate associated declines of sympatric medium to large-bodied mammal species and highlight the need for improved conservation interventions.Changes in chimpanzee abundance likely precede extirpation of sympatric mammals.

Enhancing Efavirenz Bioavailability Via Polymer-Based Buccal Administration: Optimization and Characterization of Nanocrystal-Loaded Dissolving Microneedle Delivery Systems.	Efavirenz (EFV) is a widely utilized antiretroviral agent in HIV/AIDS therapy that is known for its efficacy but is also associated with various side effects. For improved drug delivery, buccal administration offers a promising alternative by allowing the drug to enter the systemic circulation directly through the oral mucosa, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract and first-pass metabolism. This study explored the interaction between EFV and different polymers through molecular docking, revealing a strong binding affinity to Pluronic®F-127 (-2.1 kcal/mol). EFV was formulated into nanocrystals (EFV-NC) using Pluronic®F-127 as the stabilizer, characterized by an average particle size of 174.83 ± 15.21 nm, a narrow size distribution (PDI of 0.15 ± 0.013), and good stability (zeta potential of -22.27 ± 1.12 mV). FTIR and XRD analyses revealed polymer-induced alterations in the crystalline structure of the EFV. The EFV-NC formulation enhanced the solubility (up to 400 µg/mL) and achieved 89.58 ± 4.01% drug release within 24 h, following the Higuchi model kinetics for controlled release. EFV-NC-loaded dissolving microneedles (EFV-NC-DMN) demonstrated robust mechanical properties, efficient tissue penetration, and minimal moisture absorption.

As an emerging catalytic strategy, heterogeneous Piezo-Self-Fenton (EPSF) has demonstrated significant potential in fields such as environmental remediation and biomedicine in recent years. However, the catalytic reactions in this process are complex and diverse, and the understanding of high-entropy catalytic systems remains limited. In this study, we constructed a series of iron-based EPSF materials by incorporating various types of iron sources into MgO@rGO/PVDF-HFP composite piezoelectric films. The findings indicated that the type of iron source remarkably influences the EPSF efficiencies. Notably, the Fe

Tobacco treatment and policies in mental health and substance use treatment facilities in the US.	The prevalence of tobacco use among people with mental health and substance use disorders in the US is high. State- and facility-level factors could be associated with the provision of tobacco treatment and tobacco-free grounds policy in mental health and substance use treatment facilities. We estimated the latest prevalence of, and factors associated with tobacco treatment provision and tobacco-free grounds policies in these facilities. This cross-sectional study used data from the 2021-2022 National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey. Two multivariate Poisson regression models with robust standard errors were employed to estimate state- and facility-level factors associated with two outcomes: 1) provision of any tobacco treatment (screening, behavior counseling, or pharmacotherapy), and 2) having a tobacco-free grounds policy. Among over 17,300 facilities, 87.2 % provided tobacco treatment, and 38.6 % implemented tobacco-free grounds policies. Private for-profit facilities were less likely to provide tobacco treatment (Adjusted Risk Ratio [ARR] 0.87, 95 % CI 0.86-0.89). Private for-profit and nonprofit facilities, those licensed by state or tribal health agencies, and those in tobacco nation states were less likely to implement tobacco-free grounds policies. In contrast, facilities with opioid treatment programs were more likely to achieve both outcomes. Disparities exist in providing tobacco treatment and tobacco-free ground policies, particularly in privately owned facilities. Payers should incentivize the adoption of tobacco treatment and tobacco-free campus policies, and states should incorporate these requirements into licensure and/or accreditation standards for mental health and substance use treatment facilities.

Enlarged cavum septum pellucidum as a neuroimaging signature of head impact exposure.	Cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is commonly observed upon neuroimaging examination in individuals exposed to repetitive head impacts (RHI) and post-mortem in cases with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Consequently, CSP has been proposed as a potential biomarker for RHI-related neurodegeneration, yet prevalence estimates of CSP across other neurodegenerative diseases and its clinical implications are largely unknown. We assessed CSP prevalence and clinical correlates in individuals with RHI exposure, a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), a neurodegenerative disease (i.e. Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal dementia) and normal cognition.

Dian sanguis draconis improves pulmonary fibrosis by activating autophagy to regulate the PA/PAI-1 balance.	Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a severe lung disease that manifests as lung tissue destruction and collagen deposition and easily leads to respiratory failure. It is difficult to reverse these conditions using current treatment methods. This study focused on the exploration and development of novel drugs for the treatment of PF. This study simulated the pathological process of PF by using a bleomycin (BLM)-induced rat model and a TGF-β1-induced in vitro cell model. Dian sanguis draconis (DSD) was used for intervention, and the effects on the lung tissue structure, collagen fiber deposition, autophagy level and PA/PAI-1 balance were evaluated via pathological tissue staining, western blotting, and ELISA. In untreated PF rats, severely disordered lung tissue, thickened alveolar septa, and excessive deposition of collagen fibers were observed. In addition, the level of autophagy was inhibited, and the balance of PA/PAI-1 in the lung tissue was disrupted. After treatment with DSD, these pathological injuries improved, as demonstrated by the restoration of lung tissue structure, reduction in collagen fiber deposition, recovery of autophagy levels, and remodeling of the PA/PAI-1 balance. In addition, mechanistically, DSD improves PF by increasing the level of autophagy-related proteins and regulating the PA/PAI-1 balance. This study confirmed the significant effect of DSD in alleviating PF. These findings provide new drug candidates for the treatment of PF.

Multi-omics analysis of the accumulation mechanism of flavonoids in rice caryopsis under blue light.	Blue light influences the MYB gene family, resulting in varying accumulations of different flavonoids in rice caryopsis at distinct developmental stages, with a higher concentration observed in the initial stage. The regulatory effect of blue light on plant flavonoids has been extensively documented; however, its influence on the development of rice caryopsis morphology remains unreported. Through the analysis of transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolites, combined with Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), the accumulation of flavonoids in rice caryopsis under blue light at various developmental stages was thoroughly examined. Furthermore, four MYB family transcription factors (TFs) that significantly influence the structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were identified. The results indicate that the accumulation of flavonoids primarily occurs during the early stages of caryopsis development. Key structural genes, including PAL, 4CL, CHS, CHI, F3H, and FLS, are upregulated in both gene and protein expression when exposed to blue light. Moreover, the WGCNA analysis identified several TFs that may influence these genes, including Os08t0144000-01 and Os01t0695900-01, as well as the proteins Q7F3D6, Q2QM89, A0A0P0W9C3, and Q6ZDM0, all of which belong to the MYB family. The research has enhanced our understanding of flavonoid accumulation in rice caryopsis when exposed to blue light. It also establishes a framework for the synthesis of secondary metabolites induced by blue light, thereby creating more opportunities to enhance the quality of horticultural plants.

Sequencing whole genomes of the West Javanese population in Indonesia reveals novel variants and improves imputation accuracy.	Existing genotype imputation reference panels are mainly derived from European populations, limiting their accuracy in non-European populations. To improve imputation accuracy for Indonesians, the world's fourth most populous country, we combined Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data from 227 West Javanese individuals with East Asian data from the 1,000 Genomes Project. This created three reference panels: EAS 1KGP3 (EASp), Indonesian (INDp), and a combined panel (EASp + INDp). We also used ten West-Javanese samples with WGS and SNP-typing data for benchmarking. We identified 1.8 million novel single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the West Javanese population, which, while similar to the East Asians, are distinct from the Central Indonesian Flores population. Adding INDp to the EASp reference panel improved imputation accuracy (R2) from 0.85 to 0.90, and concordance from 87.88% to 91.13%. These findings underscore the importance of including West-Javanese genetic data in reference panels, advocating for broader WGS of diverse Indonesian populations to enhance genomic studies.

Plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarker relationships with incident abnormal amyloid PET.	Limited data exist on the utility of plasma biomarkers to predict incident abnormal amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). In this study we evaluate the association of plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers with amyloid PET progression among initially amyloid PET negative (A-) individuals. We included 290 A-, cognitively unimpaired Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants. We estimated the association of each baseline plasma biomarker with progression from A- to A+ and with rate of amyloid PET change. Interquartile range differences in amyloid beta 42/40, percent phosphorylated tau 217 (%p-tau217), and Amyloid Probability Score 2 were associated with 1.29 (P = 0.09), 1.38 (P < 0.001), and 1.20 (P = 0.05) increases, respectively, in the hazard of progression from A- to A+ and 0.27 (P = 0.16), 0.50 (P = 0.007), and 0.28 (P = 0.15) Centiloid/year increases, respectively, in annual rate of amyloid PET change. Plasma %p-tau217 may be a useful screening tool to enrich for participants with increased likelihood of progressing from normal to abnormal amyloid PET in a primary prevention trial. Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 was associated with amyloid positron emission tomography progression, negative to positive. The associations were weaker for amyloid beta 42/40 and Amyloid Probability Score 2. Age and apolipoprotein E ε4 carriership were also important predictors. These markers may be useful for enrichment of a primary prevention trial.

Safety and efficacy of long-term gantenerumab treatment in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease: an open label extension of the phase 2/3 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled platform DIAN-TU Trial.	Amyloid-plaque removal by monoclonal antibody therapies slows clinical progression in symptomatic Alzheimer's disease; however, the potential for delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in asymptomatic people is unknown. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) is an ongoing platform trial assessing the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational products in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD) caused by mutations. On the basis of findings of amyloid removal and downstream biological effects from the gantenerumab arm of the platform trial, we continued a 3-year open-label extension (OLE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with high doses of gantenerumab. The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 multi-arm trial (DIAN-TU-001) assessed solanezumab or gantenerumab versus placebo in participants who were between 15 years before to 10 years after their estimated years to symptom onset and had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0 (cognitively normal) to 1 (mild dementia). This study was followed by an OLE study of gantenerumab treatment, conducted at 18 study sites in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Spain, the UK, and USA. For inclusion in the OLE, participants at risk for DIAD had participated in the double-blind period of DIAN-TU-001 and were required to know their mutation status. We investigated increasing doses of gantenerumab up to 1500 mg subcutaneous every 2 weeks. Due to the lack of a regulatory path for gantenerumab, the study was stopped early after a pre-specified interim analysis (when most participants had completed 2 years of treatment) of the clinical measure CDR-SB. The primary outcome for the final analysis was the amyloid plaque measure PiB-PET SUVR at 3 years, assessed in the modified intention to treat population (defined as participants who received any gantenerumab treatment post-OLE baseline, had at least one PiB-PET SUVR assessment prior to gantenerumab treatment, and a post-baseline assessment). All participants who received at least one dose of study drug in the OLE were included in the safety analysis. DIAN-TU-001 (NCT01760005) and the OLE (NCT06424236) are registered with clinicaltrials.gov. Of 74 participants who were recruited into the OLE study between June 3, 2020 and April 22, 2021, 73 were enrolled and received gantenerumab treatment. 47 (64%) stopped dosing due to early termination of the study by the sponsor, and 13 (18%) prematurely discontinued the study for other reasons. The mITT population for the primary analysis comprised 55 participants. At the interim analysis, the hazard ratio for clinical decline of CDR-SB in asymptomatic mutation carriers was 0.79 (n=53, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.32) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab in either the double-blind or OLE period (Any Gant), and 0.53 (n=22, 0.27 to 1.03) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab the longest (Longest Gant). At the final analysis, the adjusted mean change from OLE baseline to year 3 in PiB-PET SUVR was -0.71 SUVR (95% CI -0.88 to -0.53, p<0.0001). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities occurred in 53% (39/73) of participants: 47% (34/73) with microhaemorrhages, 30% (22/73) with oedema, and 6% (5/73) were associated with symptoms. No treatment-associated macrohaemorrhages or deaths occurred. Partial or short-term amyloid removal did not show significant clinical effects. However, long-term full amyloid removal potentially delayed symptom onset and dementia progression. Conclusions are limited due to the OLE design and use of external controls and need to be confirmed in long term trials. National Institutes on Aging, Alzheimer's Association, GHR, F.

Comparative study of cannulated compression headless screws and anatomical locking compression hook plates for fracture of fifth metatarsal base in athletes and young adults.	This study aimed to evaluate and compare the clinical effects and complications of cannulated compression headless screws (CHS) and anatomical locking compression hook plates (LCP) for fractures of the displaced fifth metatarsal base zone I in athletes and young adults. Between May 2021 and June 2023, 50 patients were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups according to the fixation method: screw (CHS group, n = 20) or plate (LCP group, n = 30). General patient information, preoperative time, length of hospital stay, operative time, and intraoperative blood loss were recorded. Therapeutic effects were evaluated at follow-up using a visual analogue scale (VAS), American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) midfoot score, and the incidence of postoperative complications. All patients were followed-up for an average of 16 months (range, 12-25 months). All patients had primary union. The operative time was shorter in the CHS group (p < 0.05). The VAS score in the CHS group immediately after surgery was lower than that in the LCP group (p < 0.05). The AOFAS midfoot score was significantly better in the LCP group at 3 months postoperatively (p < 0.05), but was not significantly different at 6 and 12 months after surgery and at the last follow-up (p > 0.05). In the LCP group, frequent mild to moderate plantar pain occurred in four patients, foreign body sensation occurred in five patients, and internal fixation was removed in seven patients with a second operation one year postoperatively. In the CHS group, a foreign body sensation occurred in one patient. There were significant differences in the complications related to internal fixation between the two groups (p < 0.05). No infections or sural nerve injuries were observed. In athletes and young adults with displaced fractures of the fifth metatarsal base zone I, the LCP provides early mobilisation and rehabilitation while increasing the incidence of complications associated with internal fixation compared with CHS.

Autoantibodies in myasthenia gravis: cluster analysis and clinical correlations.	This study aimed to explore autoantibody clusters and their correlations with clinical features in 644 myasthenia gravis (MG) patients. Medical records of 664 MG patients were reviewed. Five autoantibodies (AChR, MuSK, titin, RyR, and LRP4) were selected for cluster analysis. The various clinical manifestations were compared between clusters. Separate association analyses between individual autoantibodies and clinical manifestations as well as among different MGFA subtypes were also performed without prior clustering. Two separate autoantibody clusters were identified, with significantly different clinical manifestations. Cluster 1 (485 patients) was characterized by higher proportions of RyR-, titin-, and AChR-, while cluster 2 (179 patients) had higher proportions of RyR+, titin+, and AChR+. Cluster 2 patients were older and had elevated QMG scores and odds of complications, particularly hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and eye conditions. Individual antibody analysis revealed that male cases were more likely to be AChR+ and titin+, and older age was associated with AChR+, RyR+, and titin+. Among MGFA subtypes, significant differences were detected in AChR, MuSK, titin, complications, thymoma, and hypertension. As MG severity increased from types I to V, AChR+, RyR+, and titin+ proportions peaked at stage IIa. MuSK+ patients were relatively rare and mostly present in the subtype b group. Type b patients had higher MuSK+ prevalence and increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease incidence rates than type a cases. Overall, cluster 2 features were less favorable to patients. This study provides valuable insights into the clinical and autoantibody profiles of Chinese MG patients.	antibodies; clinical manifestations; clinical research; cluster analysis; myasthenia gravis

Intricating connections: the role of ferroptosis in systemic lupus erythematosus.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease with multiple tissue damage. However, the pathology remains elusive, and effective treatments are lacking. Multiple types of programmed cell death (PCD) implicated in SLE progression have recently been identified. Although ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, has numerous pathophysiological features similar to those of SLE, such as intracellular iron accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid metabolism disorders and concentration of damage associated-molecular patterns (DAMPs), only a few reports have demonstrated that ferroptosis is involved in SLE progression and that the role of ferroptosis in SLE pathogenesis continues to be neglected. Therefore, this review elucidates the potential intricate relationship between SLE and ferroptosis to provide a reliable theoretical basis for further research on ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of SLE.	damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs); ferroptosis; interferons (IFNs); mitochondrial; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

The study aimed to assess eligibility for donanemab phase 3 trial in participants of the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia consistent with Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical syndrome, positive brain amyloid burden, and available tau PET. There were 817 study participants, 60-85 years old, with MCI or dementia consistent with AD clinical syndrome. Applying the Mini-Mental State Examination criteria (20 to 28) and excluding participants with imaging contraindications reduced the sample to 769; 275 participants had amyloid PET available, of whom 130 had also tau PET at the same visit; 56 participants were amyloid positive, had tau PET available at the same visit, and of those, 27 had evidence of tau pathology measured by 18F-flortaucipir PET imaging. Additional eligibility criteria reduced the eligible participants to 23 % (13 out of 56 participants). Neuroimaging findings, central nervous system exclusions, and history of malignancy were the major exclusions.	Clinical trials; Donanemab; Eligibility

Brain tissue metal concentrations and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in total joint arthroplasty patients versus controls.	We examined whether total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is associated with increased metal accumulation in the brain and histopathologic changes of Alzheimer's disease. We measured ultra-trace metal concentrations (aluminum, chromium, cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, and vanadium) on postmortem frozen tissues of the occipital lobe of 177 subjects (89 non-TJA and 88 TJA) using a triple-quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and correlated elemental concentrations to the degree of Alzheimer's disease neuropathic change (ADNC). To effectively assess the relationship between TJA and brain metal concentrations, subjects with and without TJA were matched for baseline clinical characteristics and showed no difference in postmortem Alzheimer's disease neuropathic change. TJA subjects had increased concentrations of cobalt and titanium and both metals were associated with increased amyloid plaques. In both the TJA and non-TJA subjects, increased concentrations of cobalt, titanium, manganese, and molybdenum were associated with increased odds of neuritic and diffuse plaques. Lastly, the brain's inter-metal correlations were altered in the presence of increased neuritic plaques and/or implantable artificial joints. These findings suggest that metal concentrations and homeostasis vary in presence of TJA.	Alzheimer disease pathology; Arthroplasty; Autopsy; Chromium; Cobalt; Titanium

De Novo MET-amplified NSCLC treated with savolitinib achieved remarkable tumor regression: a case report and review of literature.	Primary MET amplification is an infrequent tumorigenic driver gene alteration identified in pulmonary neoplasms. Data on the effectiveness of MET-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in de novo MET amplification are relatively scarce, and there remains a dearth of empirical evidence supporting the use of precision therapy as first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary MET amplification. We present a case of advanced lung adenocarcinoma in an elderly patient with primary MET amplification. The patient had an initial ECOG Performance Status (PS) 2. DNA-NGS analysis of tissue samples revealed a MET gene copy number (GCN) of 8, indicating MET amplification, without other oncogenic mutations associated with available drugs being detected. This finding was validated by MET fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which showed cluster amplification. Initial treatment with savolitinib resulted in a sustained partial response lasting more than sixteen months. Our results suggest that savolitinib is effective and safe for the treatment of elderly patients with de novo amplified MET metastatic NSCLC and may therefore be considered a potential treatment option worthy of prospective study confirmation.

Longitudinal analysis of a dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease mutation carrier protected from dementia.	We conducted an in-depth longitudinal study on an individual carrying the presenilin 2 p.Asn141Ile mutation, traditionally associated with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (AD), who has remarkably remained asymptomatic past the expected age of clinical onset. This study combines genetic, neuroimaging and biomarker analyses to explore the underpinnings of this resilience. Unlike typical progression in dominantly inherited AD, tau pathology in this case was confined to the occipital region without evidence of spread, potentially explaining the preservation of cognitive functions. Genetic analysis revealed several variants that, although not previously associated with protection against AD, suggest new avenues for understanding disease resistance. Notably, environmental factors such as significant heat exposure and a unique proteomic profile rich in heat shock proteins might indicate adaptive mechanisms contributing to the observed phenotype. This case underscores the complexity of Alzheimer's pathology and suggests that blocking tau deposition could be a promising target for therapeutic intervention. The study highlights the need for further research to identify and validate the mechanisms that could inhibit or localize tau pathology as a strategy to mitigate or delay the onset of Alzheimer's dementia.

Clinical value of Metagenomic Next- and Third-Generation Sequencing applied in ultrasound-guided puncture biopsy for diagnosing lymph node tuberculosis.	The aim of this study was to assess the clinical utility of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and metagenomic third-generation sequencing (mTGS) in diagnosing cervical lymph node tuberculosis through analysis of lymph node tissue. This study recruited 101 patients with suspected cervical lymph node tuberculosis and took samples under ultrasound guidance. Parallel culture, X-pert, mNGS and mTGS workflows to each sample were performed. Taking clinical diagnosis as the gold standard, We comparatively compared diagnosis performance of the four methods. Clinically, 76 cases were diagnosed as lymph node tuberculosis and 20 cases were non-lymph node tuberculosis. Compared with clinical diagnosis, the sensitivities of mNGS and mTGS were 89.47 % and 82.89 %, respectively, significantly higher than those of culture and X-pert which were 43.28 % and 68.42 %, respectively (P < 0.05). The specificity of mNGS and X-pert reached 100 %, while those of culture and mTGS were 93.75 % and 95 %, respectively. And mNGS alone identified 7 species of bacteria, 3 species of viruses, and 5 species of fungi, and identified more mixed infections. Particularly, besides Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection, mNGS may be superior to mTGS for the detection of fungi.

The landscape of autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease: global distribution and age of onset.	We present a comprehensive global analysis of genetic variants associated with autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). A total of 550 variants in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes were identified, of which 279 were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic based on ACMG-AMP criteria, utilizing data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), literature, and public databases. Symptomatic age at onset (AAO) data was estimated for 227 of these variants, allowing detailed characterization of their frequency, pathogenicity, and AAO. Importantly, 226 variants meet eligibility criteria for inclusion in disease-modifying clinical trials. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive value of mean variant AAO and parental AAO in predicting symptomatic AAO, validated against converters who became symptomatic during follow-up in the DIAN Observational Study (DIAN-OBS). This dataset provides critical insights into the global landscape of ADAD and reveals the genetic and AAO heterogeneity of ADAD variants while refining variant trial eligibility criteria.	amyloid precursor protein; pathogenicity; presenilin-1; presenilin-2; prevalence

Genome-wide identification and characterization of WRKYs family involved in responses to Cylindrocarpon destructans in Panax notoginseng.	WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators of plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Previous studies demonstrated that the role of WRKY TFs play in the disease resistance of Panax notoginseng, the causal agent of root rot disease. However, comprehensive genome-wide analyses of WRKY genes in this species remain scarce. We identified 79 WRKY genes in the P. notoginseng genome, classifing them into three groups based on structural features and phylogenetic relationships: Class I (14 genes), Class II (55 genes), and Class III (10 genes). Of these, 58 PnWRKY genes were mapped to the P. notoginseng chromosomes and showed collinearity with Arabidopsis thaliana, Daucus carota, and three Solanaceae species. Expression analysis revealed that 53 PnWRKY genes were actively transcribed across various tissues, including roots, flowers, stems, rhizomes, and different root parts. Furthermore, PnWRKY genes responded to Cylindrocarpon destructans infection and were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). Notably, the ectopic expression of PnWRKY35 in tobacco enhanced resistance to C. destructans, accompanied by increased levels of gibberellins (GA This study demonstrated that the WRKY family in P. notoginseng plays a significant role in resistance to root rot disease. PnWRKY genes are responsive to MeJA and SA induction as well as C. destructans infection. Moreover, ectopic expression of PnWRKY35 activates multiple plant disease resistance pathways, increases phytohormone levels, and enhance resistance to C. destructans. These findings provide a foundation for future exploration of the mechanism underlying P. notoginseng resistance to root rot disease.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients with autoimmune disease: Safety and efficacy.	The utilization of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer immunotherapy frequently leads to the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), making it generally not recommended for patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis on safety and efficacy of ICIs in cancer patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases to provide further insights. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched until December 20, 2024. The main summary measures used were pooled rate and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidential interval (CI), which were analyzed using R statistic software. A total of 52 articles were included in the study. When cancer patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases received ICIs treatment, the overall incidence was 0.610 (95% CI: 0.531-0.686) for any grade irAEs, 0.295 (95% CI: 0.248-0.343) for flares, 0.325 (95% CI: 0.258-0.396) for de novo irAEs, 0.238 (95% CI: 0.174-0.309) for grade ≥3 irAEs, and 0.143 (95% CI: 0.109-0.180) for discontinuation due to immunotoxicity. Compared with those without autoimmune diseases, cancer patients with autoimmune diseases experienced a higher risk of any-grade irAEs (RR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.12-1.35) and discontinuation due to immunotoxicity (1.40, 95% CI: 1.11-1.78). However, no statistically significant differences were observed in the incidence of grade ≥3 irAEs, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups. During ICIs treatment, irAEs are common among cancer patients with autoimmune diseases, but severe irAEs is relatively low. ICIs are effective in this population, but should be strictly monitored when used to avoid immunotoxicity.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors; autoimmune diseases; meta-analysis; safety and efficacy; tumor

Indocyanine green nebulization visualizes the pulmonary bronchus during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.	Intraoperative tracheobronchial injury is a rare but serious complication of lung surgery. With the increasing number of segmentectomies, surgeons need to locate finer and less easily identified segmental bronchi or even subsegmental bronchi. However, there is no simple or feasible method for visualizing the bronchus during surgery. Herein, we report a case in which indocyanine green (ICG) inhalation was used to visualize the pulmonary bronchus during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The patient was a woman with a GGO located in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, and thoracoscopic segmentectomy was scheduled. ICG (3.75 mg/ml) was inhaled into the lung on the operative side after single-lung ventilation for 5 min. During surgery, the anterior segmental bronchus was difficult to locate accurately. Under the overlay imaging window of the NIF imaging system, the bronchus was shown in green, indicating the bronchi in contrast to the surrounding lung tissue. We dissected the bronchi with the assistance of fluorescence imaging and were surprised to find that the bifurcation of the anterior and apical bronchi could be clearly identified by navigation via the inhaled ICG and NIF system. Segmentectomy was successfully performed, and no adverse events were recorded. This case showed that ICG nebulization is feasible and safe for visualizing the pulmonary bronchus during thoracoscopic surgery. This method has great application potential for reducing intraoperative tracheobronchial injury.

Gait Speed Modifies Efficacy of Home-Based Exercise for Falls in Older Adults With a Previous Fall: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.	"Exercise is an evidence-based strategy for preventing falls. However, its efficacy may vary based on individual characteristics, like gait speed. This study examined whether baseline gait speed modified the effects of home-based exercise on subsequent falls among older adults. This is a secondary analysis of a 12-month, randomized controlled trial in community-dwelling adults who were ≥70 years old and who had fallen within the previous 12 months. Participants were randomized to either 12 months of home-based exercise (n = 172) or standard of care (n = 172). This study examined intervention effects on fall rates at 6 and 12 months stratified by baseline gait speed (slow [<0.80 m/s] or normal [≥0.80 m/s]) using negative binomial regressions. Baseline gait speed was investigated as a potential modifier of the intervention effects on mobility and cognitive function using linear mixed modeling. At baseline, 134 participants had slow (exercise = 70; standard of care = 64) and 210 had normal (exercise = 102; standard of care = 108) gait speeds. For participants with slow gait speed, exercise reduced fall rates by 44% at 6 months (incidence rate ratio = 0.56; 95% CI [confidence interval] = 0.33-0.95) but not at 12 months (incidence rate ratio = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.38-1.03) compared with standard of care; for participants with normal gait speed, there was no significant effect of exercise on fall rates at 6 or 12 months. Gait speed modified intervention effects; in the exercise group, participants with slow gait showed significant improvements in the Timed ""Up & Go"" Test at 6 months (estimated mean difference = -4.05; 95% CI = -6.82 to -1.27) and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test at 12 months (estimated mean difference = 2.51; 95% CI = 0.81-4.21). Older adults with slow gait speed had a reduction in subsequent falls in response to exercise at 6 months. Gait speed modified the effects of exercise on mobility and cognition. Older adults with slow gait speed may be a target population for exercise-based fall prevention."	Cognitive Function; Exercise; Falls; Older Adults; Physical Function

Correlations between spinopelvic parameters and health-related quality of life in degenerative lumbar scoliosis patients before and after long -level fusion surgery.	For degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS), prior studies mainly focused on the preoperative relationship between spinopelvic parameters and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), lacking an exhaustive evaluation of the postoperative situation. Therefore, the postoperative parameters most closely bonded with clinical outcomes has not yet been well-defined in DLS patients. The objective of this study was to comprehensively assess the correlation between radiographic parameters and HRQoL before and after surgery, and to identified the most valuable spinopelvic parameters for postoperative curative effect. This study retrospectively reviewed 130 consecutive patients who underwent long-level fusion with at least 1 year follow-up. Standing whole-spine radiographs and HRQoL measurements were examined preoperatively and at final follow-up. Spinopelvic parameters included thoracic kyphosis (TK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis (PI-LL), pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), T1 pelvic angle (TPA), Global tilt (GT), Cobb angle (CA), apical vertebral translation (AVT) and coronal vertical axis (CVA). HRQoL was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Chinese version of Lumbar Stiffness Disability Index (C-LSDI), Japanese Orthopedic Association-29 (JOA-29), Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22),and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) total and subscale scores. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to determine relationships between them. The study population included 104 women and 26 men with an average age of 62.9 years. Both coronal and sagittal parameters showed significant correlations with HRQoL scores pre- and post-operatively. Among the coronal parameters, only CA showed correlations with SRS-22 subscale scores, and its correlation with Self-image scores were observed both before and after surgery. Among sagittal parameters, PT, PI-LL, LL, SVA, TPA, and GT showed significant correlations with HRQoL before surgery, including ODI, JOA-29, and SF-36 PCS. At final follow-up, except for AVT, CVA, and LL, all other sagittal parameters were significantly correlated with HRQoL. HRQoL scores not only correlated with radiological parameters before surgery, but also after long-term follow-up. Besides, sagittal parameters, especially postoperative PI-LL, SVA, TPA, GT, were more closely correlated with clinical outcome measurements.

Amyloid-β and tau deposition in traumatic brain injury: a study of Vietnam War veterans.	Traumatic brain injury is widely viewed as a risk factor for dementia, but the biological mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear. In previous studies, traumatic brain injury has been associated with the hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's disease, i.e. amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau. Depending on the type and location of trauma, traumatic brain injury can induce spatially heterogeneous brain lesions that may pre-dispose for the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology in aging. Therefore, we hypothesized that a history of traumatic brain injury may be related to spatially heterogeneous amyloid-β and tau pathology patterns that deviate from the stereotypical temporo-parietal patterns in Alzheimer's disease. To test this, we included 103 Vietnam War veterans of whom 65 had experienced traumatic brain injury (	PET; amyloid-β; tau; traumatic brain injury; war veterans

In silico identification of a phosphate marine steroid from Indonesian marine compounds as a potential inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol mannosyltransferase (PimA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.	A higher death rate is associated with multiple factors, including medication resistance and co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This shows the need to obtain new and effective drug candidates in improving tuberculosis (TB) treatment. In addition, the phosphatidylinositol mannosyltransferase (PimA) enzyme starts the production of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol. PimA has been identified as a key enzyme and an important area for further research in the development of anti-TB drugs. Previous research investigated various applications including marine resources driven by a deeper understanding of the distinctive features of the ecosystem and the diverse array of organisms. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the potential of Indonesian marine compounds as inhibitors of PimA, with a focus on binding energy, interaction modes, and stability using docking and molecular dynamics (MD) investigation methodologies. The results show that a total of 84 Indonesian marine compounds are effectively docked to the PimA to obtain compounds 21, 27, and 33 for further investigation. Based on the MD analysis, compound 27 (desulfohaplosamate) is the most promising candidate among the new MTB-PimA inhibitors. Compounds bind to PimA, as shown by a strong affinity of -30.09 kJ/mol, and form hydrogen bonds with the key amino acid residue Gly16. Furthermore, a stable complex is formed to easily analyze the antibacterial agents targeting MTB in the future.	Docking; Marine compounds; Molecular dynamics; Mycobacterium tuberculosis

Depressive Symptoms and Amyloid Pathology.	Depressive symptoms are associated with cognitive decline in older individuals. Uncertainty about underlying mechanisms hampers diagnostic and therapeutic efforts. This large-scale study aimed to elucidate the association between depressive symptoms and amyloid pathology. To examine the association between depressive symptoms and amyloid pathology and its dependency on age, sex, education, and APOE genotype in older individuals without dementia. Cross-sectional analyses were performed using data from the Amyloid Biomarker Study data pooling initiative. Data from 49 research, population-based, and memory clinic studies were pooled and harmonized. The Amyloid Biomarker Study has been collecting data since 2012 and data collection is ongoing. At the time of analysis, 95 centers were included in the Amyloid Biomarker Study. The study included 9746 individuals with normal cognition (NC) and 3023 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) aged between 34 and 100 years for whom data on amyloid biomarkers, presence of depressive symptoms, and age were available. Data were analyzed from December 2022 to February 2024. Amyloid-β1-42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid positron emission tomography scans were used to determine presence or absence of amyloid pathology. Presence of depressive symptoms was determined on the basis of validated depression rating scale scores, evidence of a current clinical diagnosis of depression, or self-reported depressive symptoms. In individuals with NC (mean [SD] age, 68.6 [8.9] years; 5664 [58.2%] female; 3002 [34.0%] APOE ε4 carriers; 937 [9.6%] had depressive symptoms; 2648 [27.2%] had amyloid pathology), the presence of depressive symptoms was not associated with amyloid pathology (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 0.90-1.40; P = .29). In individuals with MCI (mean [SD] age, 70.2 [8.7] years; 1481 [49.0%] female; 1046 [44.8%] APOE ε4 carriers; 824 [27.3%] had depressive symptoms; 1668 [55.8%] had amyloid pathology), the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with a lower likelihood of amyloid pathology (OR, 0.73; 95% CI 0.61-0.89; P = .001). When considering subgroup effects, in individuals with NC, the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with a higher frequency of amyloid pathology in APOE ε4 noncarriers (mean difference, 5.0%; 95% CI 1.0-9.0; P = .02) but not in APOE ε4 carriers. This was not the case in individuals with MCI. Depressive symptoms were not consistently associated with a higher frequency of amyloid pathology in participants with NC and were associated with a lower likelihood of amyloid pathology in participants with MCI. These findings were not influenced by age, sex, or education level. Mechanisms other than amyloid accumulation may commonly underlie depressive symptoms in late life.

Glutamine, Serine and Glycine at Increasing Concentrations Regulate Cisplatin Sensitivity in Gastric Cancer by Posttranslational Modifications of KDM4A.	Gastric cancer is a common digestive system tumor with a high resistance rate that reduces the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Nutrition therapy is an important adjuvant approach to favor the prognosis of gastric cancer. Dietary amino acids contribute greatly to gastric cancer progression by mediating tumor gene expressions, epigenetics, signal transduction, and metabolic remodeling. In the present study, 20 types of amino acids were screened and glutamine, glycine and serine were identified as the critical regulators of cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, KDM4A acetylation drove the reduced chemotherapy sensitivity in gastric cancer cells by maintaining protein stability and activating DNA repair ability when the concentrations of glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), and glycine (Gly) decreased. Conversely, Gln/Ser/Gly at increasing concentrations stimulated ubiquitination degradation of KDM4A, which in turn elevated the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy. Our findings unveiled the role of amino acid nutrition in regulating chemotherapy sensitivity of gastric cancer and the underlying mechanism, thus providing a scientific basis for expanding the clinical significance of nutrition therapy for gastric cancer patients.

GLUT1 as a generic biomarker enables near-infrared fluorescence molecular imaging guided precise intraoperative tumor detection in breast cancer.	Precise tumor excision is important but challenging in breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Tumor-specific fluorescence imaging may be used for intraoperative tumor detection and, therefore, to guide precise tumor excision. The aims of this study are to develop a glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)-targeted near-infrared fluorescence tracer and evaluate its accuracy for breast cancer detection using fresh surgical breast specimens. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to compare GLUT1 expression between breast cancer and normal breast tissues. A GLUT1-targeted fluorescence imaging tracer WZB117-CY7.5 was developed. In combination with fluorescence imaging (FMI), its binding specificity to GLUT1 was examined in in vitro breast cancer cell experiments, in vivo 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mouse models, and 60 freshly resected human breast tumor tissues. The diagnostic accuracy of WZB117-CY7.5, was evaluated in fresh specimens derived from 60 patients diagnosed with breast cancer. GLUT1 expression is higher in breast cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. WZB117-CY7.5 specifically bound to breast cancer cells in in vitro cell experiments and accumulated in tumor areas in a 4T1 tumor-bearing mice after intravenous injection by FMI. Moreover, WZB117-CY7.5 specifically bound to freshly resected human breast cancer and demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance in discriminating breast cancer, irrespective of cancer subtype, from normal breast tissue on fresh surgically resected breast tissues. WZB117-CY7.5 showed high accuracy in intraoperative breast cancer detection, irrespective of the cancer subtype. This highlights its potential for clinical applications as a generic tracer for fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) in BCS and fluorescence image-guided pathology for tissue sampling.

The additional impact of metabolic syndrome on left ventricular deformation and myocardial energetic efficiency impairment in ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries patients.	Ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) has high morbidity, mortality, and poor quality of life. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex of multiple cardiac metabolic risk factors, significantly increasing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in INOCA patients. The study aimed to investigate the aggravating effect of MetS on left ventricular (LV) deformation and function impairment in INOCA patients. This study collected 104 INOCA patients (INOCA [MetS-]: n = 56; INOCA [MetS+]: n = 48) and 41 sex- and age-matched controls. LV function, indexed myocardial energetic efficiency (MEEI), and LV global peak strains (including radial, circumferential, and longitudinal directions) were measured among the three groups. The independent factors of reduced MEEI and impaired LV function and strain parameters for all INOCA patients were assessed using multivariable linear regression analyses. In contrast to the INOCA (MetS-) group, the indexed LV stroke volume (LVSVI) (49.57 ± 11.58 mL/m MetS aggravated LV deformation and function impairment in patients with INOCA. MetS was found to be an independent factor of impaired MEEI and LV GLPS, the further decrease of MEEI and LV GLPS in INOCA patients caused by MetS might involve the synergistic injury mechanism. Early diagnosis and treatment of MetS in patients with INOCA are important.	Ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries; Metabolic syndrome; Myocardial energetic efficiency; Myocardial strain

Quantitative Assessment of the Effect of Chronic Kidney Disease on Plasma P-Tau217 Concentrations.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is known to be associated with increased plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) concentrations, potentially confounding the utility of plasma p-tau217 measurements as a marker of amyloid pathology in individuals with suspected Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we quantitatively investigate the relationship of plasma p-tau217 concentrations vs estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in individuals with CKD with and without amyloid pathology. This was a retrospective examination of data from 2 observational cohorts from either the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center cohorts. p-Tau217 was determined using the ALZpath Simoa p-tau217 immunoassay and an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay that simultaneously measures p-tau217 and nonphosphorylated-tau217 (np-tau217) to determine %p-tau217 ([p-tau217/nonphosphorylated-tau217]) × 100%) (C Participants (n = 202, mean age of 78 years, 38% female) with diagnoses of cognitive unimpairment (n = 109), mild cognitive impairment (n = 71), and dementia (n = 22) were included.

Bibliometric Analysis of Islamic Crowdfunding: A Literature Review of Its Journey.	"The potential of Islamic crowdfunding to encourage the development of Islamic fintech globally, even in countries with non-Muslim majority populations, needs to be examined in a literature study on this issue. More extensive research is needed regarding the factors that most reliably predict the success of Islamic crowdfunding, such as compliance with Islamic crowdfunding laws, sustainability, and the potential of Islamic finance. This article describes a comprehensive and systematic Literature Review (SLR) regarding papers published in the field of Islamic crowdfunding. This research aims to contribute to a better understanding of Islamic crowdfunding, provide useful information for practitioners, and stimulate further research in the field to increase the success of Islamic crowdfunding. We conducted a review of selected papers to identify gaps and significant issues in Islamic crowdfunding, providing guidance for future researchers. This article review was based on 704 articles retrieved using the keyword ""Islamic crowdfunding"" from the Scopus database between 2013 and 2022. To minimize bias, we formulated 5 research questions to guide our analysis: RQ1: How do publication and citation rates vary annually? RQ2: How can we determine the most influential studies based on citation counts for each keyword? RQ3: What are the most common subject areas addressed in Islamic crowdfunding literature from 2013 to 2022? RQ4: What are the most frequently used keywords in Scopus documents? RQ5: How are Islamic values discussed in articles related to Islamic crowdfunding? The findings of this research demonstrate that Islamic crowdfunding, characterized by interdisciplinary scholarship, has emerged as an increasingly significant alternative for aiding society and the economy. It contributes to poverty alleviation and the development of specific sectors through channels such as crowdfunding for small and medium enterprises and social projects tailored to meet the diverse needs of Muslims. However, the challenge facing the future development of Sharia crowdfunding is that, despite its benefit of increasing community participation in projects aligned with religious values, it also carries the potential risk of investment losses and non-compliance with Sharia principles. Ways to address the current scarcity of Sharia fintech are also needed, ensuring its broader acceptance across all societal levels, and enhancing Muslims' understanding of compliance with Islamic religious rules, particularly Fiqh law. Urgently needed are specific fiqh regulatory guidelines to ensure that Sharia-compliant crowdfunding adheres to Islamic principles. Government support, particularly through legislation in countries where the majority of the population is Muslim, is crucial to enhance public participation and trust in Sharia crowdfunding."

Association of plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's pathology and neurodegeneration with gait performance in older adults.	Declining gait performance is seen in aging individuals, due to neural and systemic factors. Plasma biomarkers provide an accessible way to assess evolving brain changes; non-specific neurodegeneration (NfL, GFAP) or evolving Alzheimer's disease (Aβ 42/40 ratio, P-Tau181). In a population-based cohort of older adults, we evaluate the hypothesis that plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease pathology are associated with worse gait performance. A sample of 2641 Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants with measurements of plasma biomarkers and gait parameters was analyzed in this cross-sectional study. Linear regression models using plasma biomarkers as predictors of gait parameters and adjusted for age, sex, BMI, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and cognitive diagnosis were evaluated. In this study multiple statistically significant relationships are observed for GFAP, NfL, and P-Tau181 with gait parameters. Each standard deviation increase in GFAP, NfL, and P-Tau181 is associated with a reduction in velocity of 2.100 (95% CI: -3.004, -1.196; p = 5.4 × 10 Plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease pathology are not only markers of cognitive decline but also indicate motor decline in the aging population. Decline in gait and balance occurs as an individual gets older. These changes can increase risk for falls, death and disability. However, the brain changes that cause a declining gait and balance in aging are incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated gait performance in over 2000 individuals as well as blood biomarkers that indicate evolving Alzheimer’s disease or neurodegeneration. We found that gait changes in the aging individual are associated with neurodegeneration and accumulation of Alzheimer’s disease pathology independent of their memory performance. These findings offer evidence for the role of blood biomarkers in investigating gait decline. Future research will build upon these findings to expand our understanding of brain mechanisms that contribute to gait and balance abnormalities in aging individuals.

Brain aging rejuvenation factors in adults with genetic and sporadic neurodegenerative disease.	The largest risk factor for dementia is age. Heterochronic blood exchange studies have uncovered age-related blood factors that demonstrate 'pro-aging' or 'pro-youthful' effects on the mouse brain. The clinical relevance and combined effects of these factors for humans is unclear. We examined five previously identified brain rejuvenation factors in cerebrospinal fluid of adults with autosomal dominant forms of frontotemporal dementia and sporadic Alzheimer's disease.

Sleep quality and cognitive function on self-rated health status among the elderly: Findings from the Indonesian family life survey (IFLS-5).	Cognitive decline poses a significant challenge for the elderly population globally. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of cognitive function and its associated factors among the elderly in the Indonesian family life survey's fifth wave (IFLS-5) conducted from 2014 to 2015. The study included elderly individuals aged 60 and above, excluding proxy respondents and those with missing data. Various socio-demographic, cognitive function and health-related variables were analyzed, including age, sex, education level, marital status, residence, region, economic status, current employment, self-rated health status, happiness, sleep quality, depression, loneliness, and chronic conditions. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with cognitive functions among the 2,929 elderly respondents. The results revealed that 44.6% of the respondents reported poor cognitive function. In the unadjusted model, residence (OR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.70-0.94), region of other islands (OR: 0.66; 95%CI: 0.54-0.81), sleep quality (OR: 0.53; 95%CI: 0.42-0.68), self-rated health status (OR: 1.38; 95%CI: 1.19-1.61), happiness (OR: 1.48; 95%CI: 1.22-1.79), and depression (OR: 1.22; 95%CI: 1.04-1.44) showed significant associations with cognitive function. After adjusting for confounding factors, the association remained significant for residence (OR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.66-0.89), regions other than Java, Bali, and Sumatra (OR: 0.61; 95%CI: 0.50-0.76), self-rated health (OR: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.09-1.51), happiness (OR: 1.30; 95%CI: 1.06-1.59), and sleep quality (OR: 0.60; 95%CI: 0.47-0.78). These findings emphasize the necessity of interventions aimed at enhancing sleep quality and overall health in order to preserve cognitive function among the elderly, thus potentially improving their quality of life. Implementing comprehensive health programs could significantly enhance the overall quality of life for the aging population, especially the elderly population.

Clear cell hidradenoma (CCH) is a rare type of benign breast tumor that may undergo malignant transformation in a few cases. It clinically manifests as a painless breast mass, and may include nipple discharge. Complete surgical excision with adequate safety margins is the primary treatment. A 34-year-old man developed a mass beneath the left nipple over 2 years. Although the mass was painless, it gradually enlarged over time and was accompanied by nipple discharge. Complete excision of the mass revealed that the tumor cells were arranged in solid nodule-like structures composed of clear cells and few cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Based on the results of immunohistochemical staining and MAML2 rearrangement analysis, a pathological diagnosis of breast CCH was made. The patient was followed up postoperatively for six months, during which there was no recurrence. Breast CCH differentiates from low-grade mucoepidermoid, glycogen-rich, and lipid-rich breast carcinomas. A more comprehensive understanding of breast CCH can aid pathologists in avoiding misdiagnoses during fine-needle aspiration biopsy and intraoperative frozen section diagnosis. Diagnostic clues for CCH include: (1) the presence of two types of cell morphology in the tumor, (2) immunohistochemical staining indicating p63 positivity, (3) negativity for myoepithelial markers, and (4) MAML2 gene rearrangement in certain cases. The case we reported occurred in a male patient with MAML2 gene rearrangement, which is extremely rare. Complete surgical excision with adequate safety margins is the primary treatment method for breast CCH, and close postoperative follow-up should be conducted to monitor disease recurrence.

Decoding brain structure to stage Alzheimer's disease pathology in Down syndrome.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Down syndrome (DS) is associated with changes in brain structure. It is unknown if thickness and volumetric changes can identify AD stages and if they are similar to other genetic forms of AD. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected for 178 DS adults (106 nonclinical, 45 preclinical, and 27 symptomatic). Cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were compared between DS groups and evaluated as a staging metric using receiver operating characteristic analyses. Thickness patterns were compared to those previously reported in autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD). Decreased parietal and temporal lobe thickness differentiated amyloid positivity (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.83) and impairment (AUC = 0.81), and slightly outperformed subcortical volumes (AUC = 0.8/0.74). Thickness differences in DS were more widespread, severe, and had better discriminative ability than ADAD. Cortical thickness can stage AD pathology in DS. Identification of brain regions affected by AD may aid in tracking disease course and evaluating treatment effects. DSAD is associated with reduced temporal and parietal cortical thickness. DSAD is associated with smaller hippocampal and striatal volumes. Thickness differences can stage DSAD better than other forms of AD. DSAD thickness differences are more extensive and severe than ADAD.

Lifetime risk and projected burden of dementia.	Understanding the lifetime risk of dementia can inform public health planning and improve patient engagement in prevention. Using data from a community-based, prospective cohort study (n = 15,043; 26.9% Black race, 55.1% women and 30.8% with at least one apolipoprotein E4 (APOE ε4) allele), we estimated the lifetime risk of dementia (from age 55 years to 95 years), with mortality treated as a competing event. We applied lifetime risk estimates to US Census projections to evaluate the annual number of incident dementia cases from 2020 to 2060. The lifetime risk of dementia after age 55 years was 42% (95% confidence interval: 41-43). Rates were substantially higher in women, Black adults and APOE ε4 carriers, with lifetime risks ranging from approximately 45% to 60% in these populations. The number of US adults who will develop dementia each year was projected to increase from approximately 514,000 in 2020 to approximately 1 million in 2060. The relative growth in new dementia cases was especially pronounced for Black adults. These results highlight the urgent need for policies that enhance healthy aging, with a focus on health equity.

Melanoma is a devastating form of skin cancer characterized by a high mutational burden, limited treatment success, and dismal prognosis. Although immunotherapy and targeted therapies have significantly revolutionized melanoma treatment, the majority of patients fail to achieve durable responses, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by the overwhelming accumulation of lipid peroxides, has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach in preclinical melanoma models. A deeper understanding of the ferroptosis landscape in melanoma based on its biology characteristics, including phenotypic plasticity, metabolic state, genomic alterations, and epigenetic changes, as well as the complex role and mechanisms of ferroptosis in immune cells could provide a foundation for developing effective treatments. In this review, we outline the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis, decipher the role of melanoma biology in ferroptosis regulation, reveal the therapeutic potential of ferroptosis in melanoma, and discuss the pressing questions that should guide future investigations into ferroptosis in melanoma.

Effects and Impact of Selenium on Human Health, A Review.	Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element that is crucial for human health. As a key component of various enzymes and proteins, selenium primarily exerts its biological functions in the form of selenoproteins within the body. Currently, over 30 types of selenoproteins have been identified, with more than 20 of them containing selenocysteine residues. Among these, glutathione peroxidases (GPXs), thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs), and iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) have been widely studied. Selenium boasts numerous biological functions, including antioxidant properties, immune system enhancement, thyroid function regulation, anti-cancer effects, cardiovascular protection, reproductive capability improvement, and anti-inflammatory activity. Despite its critical importance to human health, the range between selenium's nutritional and toxic doses is very narrow. Insufficient daily selenium intake can lead to selenium deficiency, while excessive intake carries the risk of selenium toxicity. Therefore, selenium intake must be controlled within a relatively precise range. This article reviews the distribution and intake of selenium, as well as its absorption and metabolism mechanisms in the human body. It also explores the multiple biological functions and mechanisms of selenium in maintaining human health. The aim is to provide new insights and evidence for further elucidating the role of selenium and selenoproteins in health maintenance, as well as for future nutritional guidelines and public health policies.	glutathione peroxidases; human health; iodothyronine deiodinases; selenium; selenoproteomics; thioredoxin reductases

To investigate the causal association of using glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists with autoimmune diseases. The available cis-eQTLs for drugs target genes (GLP1R) were used as genetic variants for exposure to GLP1R agonists. Type 2 diabetes was used as positive control. Mendelian randomizations (MR) were performed to explore the association of genetically-proxied GLP1R agonists with 11 autoimmune diseases from large-scale consortia. Replicating the findings in the FinnGen study and then pooled with meta-analysis. Finally, we performed MR analysis to examine whether GLP1R agonists affect 731 immune cell phenotypes to clarify the potential mechanism. We observed supportive evidence to support the association of GLP1R agonists with reduced the risk of hypothyroidism (OR [95 %] = 0.89 [0.82-0.95], P < 0.001), but increased risk of ulcerative colitis (OR [95 %] = 1.48 [1.27-1.71], P < 0.001), type 1 diabetes (OR [95 %] = 1.34 [1.21-1.50], P < 0.001), systemic lupus erythematosus (OR [95 %] = 1.61 [1.29-2.02], P < 0.001) and sarcoidosis (OR [95 %] = 1.38 [1.08-1.75], P = 0.008). There was no supporting evidence to verify the association of GLP1R expression with asthma, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis (P > 0.05). In addition, we found that GLP1R agonists was positively associated with 221 immune cell phenotypes (P < 0.05, OR > 1), and negatively associated with 317 immune cell phenotypes (P < 0.05, OR < 1). GLP1R agonists are causally associated with various autoimmune diseases potentially through the modulation of 731 immune cell phenotypes.	Autoimmune disease; GLP1R agonists; Mendelian randomization

Predicting cognitive decline from neuropsychiatric symptoms and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers: A machine learning approach to a population-based data.	The aim of this study was to examine the potential added value of including neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in machine learning (ML) models, along with demographic features and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, to predict decline or non-decline in global and domain-specific cognitive scores among community-dwelling older adults. To evaluate the impact of adding NPS to AD biomarkers on ML model accuracy in predicting cognitive decline among older adults. The study was conducted in the setting of the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, including participants aged ≥ 50 years with information on demographics (i.e., age, sex, education), NPS (i.e., Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire; Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories), at least one AD biomarker (i.e., plasma-, neuroimaging- and/or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]-derived), and at least 2 repeated neuropsychological assessments. We trained and tested ML models using a stepwise feature addition approach to predict decline versus non-decline in global and domain-specific (i.e., memory, language, visuospatial, and attention/executive function) cognitive scores. ML models had better performance when NPS were included along with a) neuroimaging biomarkers for predicting decline in global cognition, as well as language and visuospatial skills; b) plasma-derived biomarkers for predicting decline in visuospatial skills; and c) CSF-derived biomarkers for predicting decline in attention/executive function, language, and memory. NPS, added to ML models including demographic and AD biomarker data, improves prediction of downward trajectories in global and domain-specific cognitive scores among community-dwelling older adults, albeit effect sizes are small. These preliminary findings need to be confirmed by future cohort studies.	Alzheimer's disease biomarkers; cognitive trajectory; machine learning; neuropsychiatric symptoms

"A Bifunctional ""Two-in-One"" Array for Simultaneous Diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Identification of Low-FODMAP Diets."	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a globally prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder frequently misdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with other diseases. Currently, there are no rapid and effective diagnostic or therapeutic approaches for IBS. Despite this, low-FODMAP diets (LFDs) have become a major dietary intervention strategy for symptom relief. However, detecting FODMAPs usually relies on chromatographic techniques, which are costly and time-consuming, making it difficult to apply in real-time detection. In this study, we introduce the first dual-functional sensor array capable of rapidly diagnosing IBS and identifying low-FODMAP diets. This six-element array was constructed using nitrophenylboronic acid-modified poly(ethylenimine) coupled with coumarins through dynamic borate ester bonds across a range of pH conditions. Optimized by diverse machine learning algorithms, with the multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm proving optimal, the array enabled the simultaneous identification of 12 intestinal bacteria with 99.2% accuracy and the detection of mouse fecal specimens with varying degrees of IBS with 99.8% accuracy within seconds. Furthermore, it allowed for the detection of various FODMAP levels in commercially purchased, brand-named, and differently processed soy milk. The array demonstrates potential for use in both the clinical diagnosis of IBS and the guiding of low-FODMAP diets for patients.

Anti-inflammatory, anti-colitis, and antioxidant effects of columbianadin against DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in rats via alteration of HO-1/Nrf2 and TLR4-NF-κB signaling pathway.	Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a significant inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that typically arises from chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract. Report suggest that anti-inflammatory drug plays a crucial role in the protection of UC. The recent study demonstrated that columbianadin has a protective effect against UC induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in rats through the modulation of HO-1/Nrf2 and TLR4-NF-κB signaling pathways. In this study, Swiss Wistar rats were utilized, and UC was induced using 2% DSS. The treatment regimen included oral administration of columbianadin (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg) and sulfasalazine to the rats. The body weight, spleen index, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, food and water intake were estimated. Moreover, antioxidant, cytokines, inflammatory and apoptosis parameters were determined. mRNA expression levels were also quantitatively analyzed. Columbianadin treatment significantly (P < 0.001) boosted the body weight and suppressed the DAI. Columbianadin significantly (P < 0.001) enhanced the colon length and repressed the spleen index along with enhanced food and water intake. Columbianadin significantly (P < 0.001) suppressed the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and altered the level of oxidative stress parameters such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malonaldehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), SA; cytokines level such as interleukin (IL)-1, 1β, 6, 10, 17, 18, TNF-α; inflammatory parameters viz., cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin (PGE Columbianadin exhibited the protective effect against DSS-induced UC via alteration of HO-1/Nrf2 and TLR4-NF-κB signaling pathway.

Comparing the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and hiatal hernia repair with or without fundoplication for weight loss and gastrointestinal reflux resolution.	Evidence suggests that hiatal hernia should be repaired if found during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), either to prevent new-onset post-operative gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), or to treat pre-existing reflux symptoms. There is interest in performing laparoscopic Nissen's fundoplication (LNF) along with hiatal hernia repair (HHR) during LSG. This study aimed to determine whether hiatal crural repair alone is adequate for symptomatic control. We compared operative time, body mass index (BMI), and reflux symptoms between those undergoing LSG with HHR vs. LSG with HHR and LNF. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of patients who underwent LSG with HHR. This cohort was divided into those with LNF (group 1) and without LNF (group 2). We collected patients' pre-operative BMI and GERD Questionnaire (GERD-Q) scores. We then compared pre-operative BMI and GERD-Q values with post-operative indices at 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months. The patients' medical records for operative findings and time between both groups was analyzed. Statistical analyses included Independent Samples In this study, 978 bariatric surgeries were performed. Of 431 LSG patients, 73 fulfilled the study criteria. Both groups showed significant reduction in BMI and GERD-Q scores post-operatively. Group 1 had a decrease in BMI from an average pre-operative value of 38.03-32.17 at 6 months ( Our research with short-term results reports similar improvement in BMI and GERD symptoms in patients with LSG and HHR with or without LNF. A sound repair of hiatal crura combined with LSG leads to comparable outcomes to crural repair combined with LNF and LSG for weight loss and reflux resolution. Our short-term results do not support LNF in combination with LSG and HHR. Further research is essential to determine the long-term outcomes.

Comparison of stress related physiological parameters with biological parameters of saliva among college students - An observational study.	Stress can also be defined as a physical, mental, or emotional response to events that causes bodily or mental tension. Starting with a lack of concentration, it creates a lot of inconveniences and problems with a snowball effect. Saliva, a prime component of the oral cavity, plays an important role in oral health. Under any stressful situation, this unstimulated salivary flow rate decreases, leading to an increase in salivary acidity, which in turn leads to a reduction in the salivary pH, leading to a lot of other complications. This study was conducted to understand the difference in the levels of salivary pH and the sleep pattern of dental students during their exams. The objective is to prove that there is a marked decrease in the salivary pH and a reduction in the number of hours of sleep when the students are subjected to a stressor. 180 male and female college-going students were selected for a cross-sectional questionnaire study based on a random sampling method. A questionnaire was circulated among the subjects as Google forms, and their responses were retrieved in excel sheets. Unstimulated salivary sample were collected in a sterile manner, and pH was estimated using a pH meter. An understanding of the sleep pattern was gained using a questionnaire. This study is a descriptive analysis of varied information on stress and salivary parameters. The responses recorded were made into graphical representation; the pH analysis and flow rate were estimated, and it showed variations in subjects during the examination. This study is the first-of-its-kind in comparing parameters of saliva, sleep quality and quantity in association with stress. We concluded that psychological variables-anxiety and stress-have a significant effect on reducing salivary flow rate which ultimately leads to a reduction in salivary pH.

Comparative study of the effects of prenatal sevoflurane exposure at different cortical stages on forebrain development and maturation in offspring.	Brain development involves several critical stages, such as proliferation, neuronal migration, axonal pathfinding, and connection formation. Sevoflurane, a PSE was administered at two critical prenatal stages: embryonic day (E) 12.5 and E18.5. Double PSE inhibits the radial migration of glutamatergic neurons and promotes the tangential migration of GABAergic neurons. Specifically, early exposure (E12.5) inhibited the expression of the Pax6-Tbr2-Tbr1 cascade and the radial migration of Tbr1 in the ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas late exposure (E18.5) inhibited this process on the dorsal side. In addition, offspring mice with PSE exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviors, rather than depression, as demonstrated by reduced time spent in the center of the open-field test and in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze test. No significant differences were observed in the forced swim test, tail suspension test, or sucrose preference test. Furthermore, learning and memory impairments were observed in the Morris water maze. Our results indicate that PSE at E12.5 and E18.5 leads to abnormalities in the migration of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, affecting long-term anxiety-like behaviors and causing learning and memory impairments in offspring mice.

Successful Outcome of Two-Stage Strabismus Surgery in a Rare Case of Unilateral Möbius Syndrome: A Case Report.	Möbius syndrome (MBS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by facial and abducens palsy which is usually bilateral and may involve multiple cranial nerves. Additional features, such as craniofacial anomalies, tongue malformations, and limb defects, may also be present. The etiology of this syndrome is not well established but the ischemic necrosis of the brainstem leading to hypoplasia of the cranial nerve nuclei is the supposed to be most likely one. MBS leads to a large angle esotropia along with bilateral limitation of abduction with delayed diagnosis, which is very challenging to correct with a single procedure. There are only a few reports illustrating the surgical outcome of strabismus in MBS. In this case report, we describe an unusual case of unilateral MBS who presented with large esotropia since childhood and was managed by two-stage strabismus surgery, including unilateral medial rectus (MR) muscle recession followed by vertical recti transposition. The final primary position alignment was satisfactory. Therefore, MR muscle recession alone is an effective first procedure of choice for mild-to-moderate esotropia in patients with MBS, whereas severe cases may further require the transposition of vertical recti. As it is a congenital condition, early surgical intervention may prevent amblyopia and provide an opportunity for the development of binocular single vision. Hence, prompt diagnosis and early surgical intervention are of utmost importance in these cases.	Medial rectus recession; Möbius syndrome; strabismus surgery; vertical rectus transposition

Clinical data investigation identifies MARK3 as an oncogenic driver in castration-resistant prostate cancer.	Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) represents an aggressive and fatal form of prostate cancer that emerges following resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. Despite the availability of various drugs that can enhance the quality and prolong the survival of CRPC patients, resistance to these therapies is frequently observed, making the disease increasingly difficult to treat. Altered expression of kinases and phosphatases is a critical driver of CRPC and presents a potential target for more effective treatments. In this study, we have performed comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of ∼359 normal and CRPC patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify the differentially expressed kinases and phosphatases in patient samples. We shortlisted the candidate genes based on their differential expression profiles, associations with patient survival, Gleason scores, and their impact on the fitness of prostate cancer cell lines. Our in-silico analysis identified microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 3 (MARK3) as a novel CRPC driver that is upregulated in CRPC patients, linked with poor survival outcomes, and affects the fitness of CRPC cells. Furthermore, we found that pharmacological inhibition of MARK3 using PCC0208017, a MARK3 inhibitor, leads to reduced cell viability, migration potential, and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase in prostate cancer cells. Additionally, RNA sequencing analysis in 22Rv1 cells treated with the MARK3 inhibitor revealed that MARK3 influences genes involved in androgen response, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, mTOR, and myc-signalling, underscoring its pivotal role in CRPC progression. Taken together, our results establish MARK3 as a novel and promising therapeutic target in CRPC.	22Rv1; CRPC; Cancer; MARK3; PCC0208017; Prostate cancer

Biomechanical comparison of tendon repair techniques: Bunnell suture leads in mode of failure and minimally invasive configuration in elongation.	In this experimental study, the Minimally Invasive Configuration (MIC), the Bunnell, Kessler and modified Bunnell-Kessler techniques for tendon rupture repair were compared in terms of the following biomechanical parameters: maximum load, mode of failure, failure elongation, tension/construct elongation and stiffness (Young's modulus). The scope of comparison involves understanding the properties of each suture technique in hopes of eventually contributing to surgical decision-making. Thirty-two frozen ovine specimens were obtained, and transverse tenotomy was performed on each. Eight tendons were randomly allocated to each technique. Specimens were tested performing a unidirectional tensile load to failure using a servo-hydraulic testing device. The tendons were also loaded to failure at a rate of 10 mm/s. The total length of the construct was defined as the distance from the two clamps. Stiffness was calculated by determining the slope of the force-displacement curve in the linear region. Total failure was defined as a drop of measured force or rupture of the tendon-suture complex. In the mode of failure, Tukey's post hoc test showed a statistically significant difference between the Bunnell group and the other three groups ( The Bunnell suture performed best in terms of mode of failure, while the MIC suture technique outperformed the rest in terms of tension/construct elongation. Findings show sufficient biomechanical evidence to support the ongoing clinical application of all techniques. Level V.

Mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament injury-induced disruption of joint homeostasis and onset of osteoarthritis.	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive joint disorder that leads to pain and disability for millions of people worldwide. Post-traumatic OA (PTOA), a form of OA, arises secondary to joint injury and often impacts younger individuals. Among the most common joint injuries leading to disrupted joint homeostasis and PTOA is anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Even with successful surgical stabilization, the risk of developing PTOA persists due to several factors, including altered biology that contributes to disease progression. Recent research into the biology of ACL injuries has advanced our understanding of the mechanisms by which PTOA develops, including the inflammatory pathways involved, the expression of biomarkers specific to ACL injuries, and their interaction with factors such as the chronicity of the injury. Evidence suggests that homeostatic balance of anabolic and catabolic processes in the knee is disturbed after ACL tears, triggering a catabolic and degenerative phenotype, ultimately leading to premature joint degeneration, pain, and disability. Several key knowledge gaps exist, such as the determinants of the transition from acute to chronic inflammation, inter-patient variability in inflammatory responses, and influence of systemic factors on disease development. PTOA research faces numerous challenges, including protracted nature of the disease, the complexity of joint biology, and difficulties in translating molecular discoveries into clinical practice. Future research should prioritize improving biomarker precision for early detection, developing targeted therapies, and leveraging emerging technologies like machine learning to personalize treatment. This approach will enhance our understanding of the biological basis of PTOA resulting from ACL injuries and identify opportunities to mitigate the long-term consequences of these injuries.

The interaction of intense laser pulses with matter leads to various applications since it enables the transformation of the state of matter owing to a localized energy deposition. The advances in this field rely in particular on the understanding of physical processes at play and the ability to evaluate such a laser energy deposition. The latter can be achieved by developing modeling and associated numerical codes, which have to be efficient to possibly address complex geometries and perform parametric studies. Within this framework, we have developed an efficient numerical tool to describe the interaction of a nanosecond laser pulse with a dielectric material. This description includes the laser propagation, which is consistently coupled to the laser-induced electron dynamics, from which the laser energy deposition is evaluated. The laser propagation and electron dynamics are described by solving the Helmholtz coupled to rate equations. A high-order finite volume scheme is introduced to solve the Helmholtz equation. The physical system dynamics is resolved through a modified Dormand-Prince algorithm, with an adaptive time step designed to efficiently account for the possible rapid change in the optical response of the target when the critical plasma density is reached. The ability of the proposed numerical scheme to efficiently tackle the laser-matter interaction problem is demonstrated. In particular, it is shown that the computational time of our approach can be shorter by one order of magnitude than the one obtained with the usual fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.

Critical heat current fluctuations in Curie-Weiss model in and out of equilibrium.	In some models of nonequilibrium phase transitions, fluctuations of the analyzed currents have been observed to diverge with system size. To assess whether this behavior is universal across phase transitions, we examined heat current fluctuations in the Curie-Weiss model, a paradigmatic model of the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition, coupled to two thermal baths. This model exhibits phase transitions driven by both the temperature and the magnetic field. We find that at the temperature-driven phase transition, the heat current noise consists of two contributions: the equilibrium part, which vanishes with system size, and the nonequilibrium part, which diverges with system size. For small temperature differences, this leads to nonmonotonic scaling of fluctuations with system size. In contrast, at the magnetic-field-driven phase transition, heat current fluctuations do not diverge when observed precisely at the phase transition point. Instead, out of equilibrium, the noise is enhanced at the magnetic field values away but close to the phase transition point, due to stochastic switching between two current values. The maximum value of noise increases exponentially with system size, while the position of this maximum shifts towards the phase transition point. Finally, on the methodological side, the paper demonstrates that current fluctuations in large systems can be effectively characterized by combining a path-integral approach for macroscopic fluctuations together with an effective two-state model describing subextensive transitions between the two macroscopic states involved in the phase transition.

We explore the dynamics and transport properties of the rational standard nontwist map (RSNM), which works as an extension of the standard nontwist map (SNM). In addition to the usual parameters of the SNM that govern the twist function profile and the intensity of the nonlinear perturbation, we introduce a new perturbation parameter μ in the RSNM, which makes it possible to break the symmetry of the system. The symmetry breaking leads to directed transport, known as the ratchet effect, where chaotic orbits exhibit a preferential direction of motion. We analyze the impact of μ on both the phase space and the parameter space structure, focusing on the destruction of transport barriers, which acts as separators between chaotic regions. Through numerical simulations and analysis of the fixed points stability, we demonstrate that an increase in μ enhances the chaotic volume in the lower half of the phase space, resulting in the destruction of invariant spanning curves, while simultaneously regularizing the upper half. Additionally, we explore the conditions under which partial transport barriers persist and their role in moderating transport across the phase space. We show that even small variations in a control parameter causes crossings of invariant manifolds from different regions of the phase space, enhancing transport with the mechanism of turnstiles and intercrossing. Our analysis of directed transport reveals that the breaking of symmetry by μ results in either positive or negative net transport in the phase space, depending on the control parameters. We also note that RSNM creates new regions within the parameter space, referred to as holes, due to the emergence of transport within previously null transport regions.

Influence of the two-temperature effect on ionization potential depression in hot dense plasma.	In hot dense plasma, the interaction between charged particles leads to the ionization potential depression (IPD), which further affects the physical properties of plasma, such as opacity and equation of state. The experiment of IPD of solid-density Al plasma has indicated that present theoretical models cannot give reasonable descriptions of the IPD in hot dense plasma. So, reasonable theoretical methods are needed to describe the effects of hot dense environments on IPD, and the process of generating hot dense plasmas through the interaction between ultrashort laser pulse and solid-density matter also needs to be carefully considered. In the manuscript, two kinds of temperatures for ions and electrons are considered when we compute the ionization potential depression in hot dense plasma. And, the influences of the hot dense environments are included in the electronic structure calculations by using the modified flexible atomic code (FAC), which has included the screening of free electrons and the correlation of ions by correlation functions obtained from the hyper-netted chain (HNC) approximation. A self-consistent-field method is used to calculate the electronic structures. Based on the calculations, the IPD is obtained through the two-step model. Considering the interaction of the femtosecond laser on the solid-density Al plasma of Ciricosta's experiment, we use the two-temperature model to calculate the IPD in nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium, and the theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental results. In addition, we also calculated the electron collision ionization cross section and compared it with the results from other models.

Stability and dynamics of massive vortices in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates.	The study of structures involving vortices in one component and bright solitary waves in another has a time-honored history in two-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. In the present work, we revisit this topic, extending considerations well past the near-integrable regime of nearly equal scattering lengths. Instead, we focus on stationary states and spectral stability of such structures for large values of the intercomponent interaction coefficient. We find that the state can manifest dynamical instabilities for suitable parameter values. We also explore a phenomenological, yet quantitatively accurate upon suitable tuning, particle model which, also in line with earlier works, offers the potential of accurately following the associated stability and dynamical features. Finally, we probe the dynamics of the unstable vortex-bright structure, observing an unprecedented, to our knowledge, instability scenario in which the oscillatory instability leads to a patch of vorticity that harbors and eventually ejects multiple vortex-bright structures.

Three-dimensional construction of hyperuniform, nonhyperuniform, and antihyperuniform disordered heterogeneous materials and their transport properties via spectral density functions.	Rigorous theories connecting physical properties of a heterogeneous material to its microstructure offer a promising avenue to guide the computational material design and optimization. The spectral density function χ[over ̃]_{_{V}}(k), which can be obtained experimentally from scattering data, enables accurate determination of various transport and wave propagation characteristics, including the time-dependent diffusion spreadability S(t) and effective dynamic dielectric constant ε_{e} for electromagnetic wave propagation. Moreover, χ[over ̃]_{_{V}}(k) determines rigorous upper bounds on the fluid permeability K. Given the importance of χ[over ̃]_{_{V}}(k), we present here an efficient Fourier-space based computational framework to construct three-dimensional (3D) statistically isotropic two-phase heterogeneous materials corresponding to targeted spectral density functions. In particular, we employ a variety of analytical functional forms for χ[over ̃]_{_{V}}(k) that satisfy all known necessary conditions to construct disordered stealthy hyperuniform, standard hyperuniform, nonhyperuniform, and antihyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous material systems at varying phase volume fractions. We show that by tuning the correlations in the system across length scales via the targeted functions, one can generate a rich spectrum of distinct structures within each of the above classes of materials. Importantly, we present the first realization of antihyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous materials in 3D, which are characterized by autocovariance function χ_{_{V}}(r) with a power-law tail, resulting in microstructures that contain clusters of dramatically different sizes and morphologies. We also determine the diffusion spreadability S(t) and estimate the fluid permeability K associated with all of the constructed materials directly from the corresponding spectral densities. Although it is well established that the long-time asymptotic scaling behavior of S(t) only depends on the functional form of χ[over ̃]_{_{V}}(k), with the stealthy hyperuniform and antihyperuniform media, respectively, achieving the most and least efficient transport, we find that varying the length-scale parameter within each class of χ[over ̃]_{_{V}}(k) functions can also lead to orders of magnitude variation of S(t) at intermediate and long time scales. Moreover, we find that increasing the solid volume fraction ϕ_{1} and correlation length a in the constructed media generally leads to a decrease in the dimensionless fluid permeability K/a^{2}, while the antihyperuniform media possess the largest K/a^{2} among the four classes of materials with the same ϕ_{1} and a. These results indicate the feasibility of employing parameterized spectral densities for designing composites with targeted transport properties.

Non-Gaussian behavior in fractional Laplace motion with drift.	We study fractional Laplace motion (FLM) obtained from subordination of fractional Brownian motion (FBM) to a gamma process in the presence of an external drift that acts on the composite process or of an internal drift acting solely on the parental process. We derive the statistical properties of this FLM process and find that the external drift does not influence the mean-squared displacement, whereas the internal drift leads to normal diffusion, dominating at long times in the subdiffusive Hurst exponent regime. We also investigate the intricate properties of the probability density function (PDF), demonstrating that it possesses a central Gaussian region whose expansion in time is influenced by FBM's Hurst exponent. Outside of this region, the PDF follows a non-Gaussian pattern. The kurtosis of this FLM process converges toward the Gaussian limit at long times insensitive to the extreme non-Gaussian tails. Additionally, in the presence of the external drift, the PDF remains symmetric and centered at x=vt. In contrast, for the internal drift this symmetry is broken. The results of our computer simulations are fully consistent with the theoretical predictions. The FLM model is suitable for describing stochastic processes with a non-Gaussian PDF and long-ranged correlations of the motion.

Predictive model of death acceptance among Thai Buddhist patients with chronic diseases.	A chronic disease generally leads to a decline in patients' health and shortened lives. This cross-sectional study examined death acceptance and related factors among Thai Buddhists diagnosed with chronic diseases. A convenience sample of 423 patients recruited from five tertiary hospitals in Thailand completed self-reported questionnaires. Respondents reported a moderately high level of death acceptance, with a mean score of 39.59 ± 6.52 (out of 48.00). Death anxiety, Buddhist practices, Buddhist belief, and self-efficacy explained 28% of the variance of death acceptance (R Investigation of additional variables is recommended to enhance the model's predictability. Longitudinal studies on how Buddhists' death acceptance changes with disease chronicity are needed to understand this phenomenon fully. Examining whether a causal relationship exists between death anxiety and death acceptance is also recommended. Not applicable.

The intersection of ferroptosis and non-coding RNAs: a novel approach to ovarian cancer.	Understanding the core principles of ovarian cancer has been significantly improved through the exploration of Ferroptosis, a type of cell death triggered by iron that leads to an increase in lipid peroxides. Current research has shed light on the critical functions of non-coding RNAs, such as circRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs, in regulating ferroptosis in ovarian cancer. The aim of this paper is to comprehensively analyze how ncRNAs influence the development of ferroptosis in ovarian cancer cells. In-depth exploration is undertaken to understand the intricate ways in which ncRNAs regulate essential elements of ferroptosis, including iron management and lipid peroxidation levels. We also investigate their significant involvement in the progression of this type of cellular demise. It should be emphasized that ncRNAs can impact the synthesis of crucial proteins, such as GPX4, a key contributor to the cellular defense against oxidation, and ACSL4, involved in lipid formation. In addition, we examine the correlation between ncRNAs and well-known pathways associated with oxidative stress and cell death. The consequences of these discoveries are noteworthy, since focusing on particular ncRNAs could potentially render ovarian cancer cells more vulnerable to ferroptosis, effectively combating drug resistance problems. This discussion highlights the growing significance of ncRNAs in governing ferroptosis and their potential as useful biomarkers and treatment targets for ovarian cancer. We intend to promote additional research into the involvement of ncRNAs in controlling ferroptosis, based on current findings, with the ultimate goal of informing targeted therapeutic strategies and improving long-term treatment outcomes for individuals suffering from OC.

Nocturnal baricitinib administration leads to rapid drug responses in rheumatoid arthritis: a multicenter non-randomized controlled study.	Inflammatory cytokine levels exhibit a circadian rhythm in sera, peaking from late night to early morning in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This cytokine kinetics is a recognized therapeutic target. This clinical study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of night-time baricitinib administration based on cytokine secretion. In this 52-week multicenter non-randomized controlled study, 122 patients with RA were assigned to four groups: baricitinib 2 mg morning (BAR2MORN), 2 mg evening (BAR2EVE), 4 mg morning (BAR4MORN), or 4 mg evening (BAR4EVE). The primary endpoint was assessed using the 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) at week 12. The secondary endpoints were ACR20/50/70 and changes in the clinical disease activity index (CDAI) through 52 weeks. The results were evaluated using the propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighted to reduce selection bias in patient background. BAR4EVE resulted in better primary endpoint improvement than BAR4MORN (78.2 vs. 43.3%; p < 0.001). No difference in improvement was observed in the primary endpoint between BAR2EVE and BAR2MORN (75.5 vs. 60.6%; p = 0.10). However, BAR2EVE demonstrated higher ACR20 at weeks 4, 24, and 52 and ACR50 at weeks 4 and 12 than BAR2MORN. BAR4EVE demonstrated higher ACR20/50 at weeks 4, 8, and 12 and ACR70 at weeks 8, 12, and 24 than BAR4MORN. CDAI changes were significantly reduced in BAR4EVE than in BAR4MORN at weeks 4 and 8.

Assessing disparities in cancer resources distribution in Mexico.	Given the rising cancer burden, the capacity of Mexico's healthcare system to effectively address cancer care through its current available infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. Limited availability of diagnostic and therapeutic infrastructure leads to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Countries like Mexico, should undertake comprehensive assessments of infrastructure and human resources available for cancer, including its quantification and geolocation, to understand the service gaps. This study seeks to map oncological infrastructure in Mexico in five types of cancer: breast, lung, prostate, colon, and cervix. Through a realist evaluation of publicly available databases from the High Specialty Medical Equipment National Inventory and the General Direction of Health Information, a comprehensive identification and classification of cancer resources was conducted with the intended outcome to map cancer care infrastructure in Mexico. Guided by the literature, resources necessary for diagnosis and treatment were selected by an expert consensus. Thereafter, facilities were classified by service scope into either diagnostic or diagnostic and therapeutic, and by infrastructure level into core or enhanced and then mapped geographically. From N = 14,133 unique healthcare facilities that deliver any type of healthcare, only 5% provided cancer care. Cancer-specific infrastructure that can provide diagnosis and treatment at the national level included N = 10 brachytherapy, N = 11 cobalt-60, N = 21 linear particle accelerators and N = 188 operating rooms. Five issues were found: (1) low availability of core therapeutic infrastructure across all cancer types; (2) regional and national centralization of available therapeutic infrastructure for all cancer types, whilst no centralization found in diagnostic resources; (3) inconsistent allocation of resources in densely populated areas; (4) infrastructure disparities per cancer type i.e., Lung, prostate, and breast cancer require significant investments in diagnostic infrastructure compared to cervical and colon cancer, and (5) lack of precise and updated infrastructure data from the public health system that requires either new codes or subcodes. Addressing disparities in cancer resources distribution in Mexico is a dual imperative-ensuring equity while seizing an opportunity to fortify the overall health system for people without social security coverage.

Role of IL-16 in age-related skeletal muscle atrophy: an integrated study.	In this study, we aim to explore the roles of IL-16 in sarcopenia based on older orthopedic patients and animal research. This clinical research in this study was an observational investigation and included all the older patients with orthopedic trauma admitted to our department between January 2021 and January 2022. Patients were identified with sarcopenia if they have both low hand grip strength (HGS) and low appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce the bias caused by the co-factors and levels of IL-16 between normal patients and patients with sarcopenia were compared. In animal research, mice were treated with IL-16 to identify the effects of IL-16 on muscle function and muscle mass. Then the sarcopenia models were established and the anti-IL-16 was performed to identify the potential therapeutical effect of targeting IL-16. 421 individuals were included in the clinical study, and 77 were identified as sarcopenia. In the matched populations, the serum levels of IL-16 of individuals with low HGS, ASM, and sarcopenia were significantly higher than normal individuals (all p < 0.001). The mice treated with IL-16 showed significantly impaired muscle function and physical performance and loss of muscle mass. Using anti-IL-16 antibodies may rescue the sarcopenia traits caused by botulinum toxin type A. Individuals with high levels of IL-16 may have a significantly high risk of sarcopenia. IL-16 impairs muscle function and physical performance and leads to muscle atrophy in mice, and these effects could be reduced by targeting IL-16.

Depression reduces cognitive function partly through effects on BMI and hypertension: a large observational study and Mendelian randomization analysis.	While abundant evidence suggests a correlation between depression and the risk of cognitive impairments, the causal relationship, as well as the mechanisms mediating this association, remain uncertain. We conducted an observational study within the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), simultaneously employing weighted multivariable-adjusted linear regression to explore the association between them. Subsequently, Mendelian randomization analysis was employed to investigate the causal relationship between them as well as the mediating effects. The observational analysis of NHANES data indicates that depression is independently associated with cognitive function. Regarding MR, genetically predicted depression is causally related to cognitive function in the IVW method (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14-0.78, P = 0.012). Furthermore, depression leads to obesity (OR = 1.91, P = 2.53 × 10 - 3) and elevated blood pressure (OR 2.34, P = 3.62 × 10 - 3). Waist circumference (OR = 0.85, P = 3.00 × 10 - 4), BMI (OR = 0.84, P = 1.06 × 10 - 6), and hypertension (OR = 0.95, P = 4.00 × 10 - 3) all contribute to cognitive function. Additionally, there is no causal association between cognitive function and depression (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.01, P = 0.559) in reverse Mendelian randomization. Mediation analysis indicates that BMI and hypertension mediate 9.9% and 3.6% of the cognitive function under depression conditions, respectively. Our study indicates that depression can lead to obesity and hypertension, which can reduce cognitive function. These findings underscore the importance of timely identification and management of depression in patients with cognitive impairments and suggest that treatments aimed at reducing weight and lowering blood pressure may help prevent cognitive impairment.

Animal studies reveal downregulation of the Beclin-1 autophagy pathway as shared mechanism in Autism Spectrum Disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition with complex etiology, involving genetic and environmental influences on brain development and behavior. Dysregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling alters neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity, and has emerged as a potential underlying pathway in ASD. To investigate mTOR dysregulation as a common mechanism in ASD, we performed a systematic review, and a meta-analysis of 192 studies examining mTOR signaling in diverse genetic and environmental animal models. Our random-effects model identified significant alterations in mTOR pathway-related proteins. For several proteins (p-AKT, PTEN, p-mTOR, p-EIF4e, LC3-II, p-S6K and p-S6), subgroup analyses revealed clear species-, sex-, age-, or brain region-specific effects. Interestingly, Beclin-1 was consistently downregulated across all subgroups. Our findings support mTOR-pathway dysregulation in ASD. The observed consistent downregulation of Beclin-1 highlights autophagy as a common mechanism, and provides new leads for novel ASD biomarker and treatment development.

Hemin-induced transient senescence via DNA damage response: a neuroprotective mechanism against ferroptosis in intracerebral hemorrhage.	Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses acute fatality and long-term neurological risks, in part due to hemin and iron accumulation from hemoglobin breakdown. We observed that hemin induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), prompting a senescence-like phenotype in neurons, necessitating a deeper exploration of cellular responses. Using experimental ICH models and human ICH patient tissue, we elucidate hemin-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) inducing transient senescence and delayed expression of heme oxygenase (HO-1). HO-1 co-localizes with senescence-associated β-Galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) in ICH patient tissues, emphasizing the clinical relevance of inducible HO-1 expression in senescent cells. We reveal a reversible senescence state protective against acute cell death by hemin, while repeat exposure leads to long-lasting senescence. Inhibiting early senescence expression increases cell death, supporting the protective role of senescence against hemin toxicity. Hemin-induced senescence is attenuated by a pleiotropic carbon nanoparticle that is a catalytic mimic of superoxide dismutase, but this treatment increased lipid peroxidation, consistent with ferroptosis from hemin breakdown released iron. When coupled with iron chelator deferoxamine (DEF), the nanoparticle reduces hemin-induced senescence and upregulates factors protecting against ferroptosis. Our study suggests transient senescence induced by DDR as an early potential neuroprotective mechanism in ICH, but the risk of iron-related toxicity supports a multi-pronged therapeutic approach.

Small-molecule-catalysed deamination enables transcriptome-wide profiling of N	The deamination reaction is important to both fundamental organic chemistry and biochemistry. Traditional chemical methods of deamination rely on the use of aryldiazonium salts under harsh acidic conditions, which limits the application scope for most biological substrates. Here we present an N-nitrosation strategy for deamination under mild conditions that DNA and RNA biological macromolecules can tolerate. Cooperative catalysis combining a carbonyl organocatalyst with a Lewis acid catalyst facilitates the formation of a carbon-nitro intermediate from a primary amine, which, on rearrangement into N-nitrosamine, leads to the selective deamination of unsubstituted canonical DNA/RNA bases under mild conditions. We used this approach to deaminate adenine into hypoxanthine, read as guanine by reverse transcriptases or DNA polymerases, while N

Accuracy of 3D printing of the samples in the prototyping of cavity-based metamaterials.	Recent developments in designing cavity-based metamaterials require advanced methods for prototyping measurement samples, such as 3D printing techniques, which allow for the manufacture of complicated shapes unavailable for other technologies. However, the imperfections of the printouts, which vary for different printing technologies and printer settings, may cause differences between the designed and measured acoustic performance of the samples. This paper presents a complex study of the influence of printing details on the resulting sound absorption coefficient of a simple cavity-based metamaterial consisting of a coiled-up Helmholtz resonator. A general approach for manufacturing measurement samples is discussed. It is shown that the samples should be printed in one whenever possible, and joining the parts results in the formation of microslits and leads to mismatching of the sample impedance. Different printing technologies were also compared (SLS, DLP, FDM), and it was shown that for the studied geometry, the differences obtained for different printers are negligible from a practical point of view. The settings of the FDM printer were also studied for comparison with previous works by other authors. It was shown that the printer settings and the choice of filament are less important than random printing errors, which may occur regardless of the printer settings.

The role of ladderlectin in spermatogenesis and ovarian sperm storage in the black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii).	Ladderlectin, a teleost-specific C-type lectin, has been primarily associated with innate immune defense. However, this study unveils an important role of ladderlectin in the reproductive processes of Sebastes schlegelii. Seven ladderlectin genes (SscLLs) are identified, with SscLL3604 and SscLL3605 exhibiting high testis-specificity expression. Both genes contain a C-type lectin domain (CTLD) and two carbohydrate-binding motifs (QPD and WSD), with SscLL3605 also containing a signal peptide. Notably, SscLL3604 is predominantly cytoplasmic, while SscLL3605 is found both in the cytoplasm and cell membrane. Additionally, SscLLs are primarily localized in Sertoli cells at the mRNA level but also exist in spermatids and spermatozoa at the protein level. Further analysis reveals that SscLLs are present in sperm heads and can bind to ovarian cells, hinting at a pivotal role in long-term sperm storage in ovaries. Knockdown of SscLLs in vitro demonstrates their critical role in maintaining Sertoli cells and Leydig cells within the testis. Finally, inhibition of glycosylation or treatment with antibody of SscLLs leads to an increased incidence of embryonic malformation in S. schlegelii. These findings suggest that ladderlectin may also play an important role in the regulation of reproductive processes, thereby providing an additional adaptive mechanism for the reproduction of viviparous fish.

Upper airway microcirculation remodeling in obstructive sleep apnea is not driven by endothelial activation.	Microcirculation contributes significantly to blood flow resistance, with upper airway microcirculation in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affected by endothelial activation, perturbed blood flow shear stress, and snoring-induced tissue vibration. The relevance of these mechanisms on microcirculation response and remodeling remains largely unknown but may influence management decisions in OSA. This study analyzed pharyngeal muscle tissue from non-obese, young adult patients with OSA and chronic heavy snoring. We assessed arteriole morphometry and quantified the expression of endothelial activation markers: 8-isoprostane, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelin-1, and endothelial cell specific molecule-1. Morphometric analysis of 319 arterioles (mean of 8 vessels per patient) revealed thicker walls in severe OSA compared to mild OSA without lumen reduction, indicating outward hypertrophy, and a positive correlation between the apnea-hypopnea index (a measure of OSA severity) and arteriole wall thickness. However, analysis of 1872 arterioles showed no increase in endothelial activation markers with disease severity, either in the arteriole walls or muscle tissue. This suggests that, in young non-obese adults, severe OSA likely leads to adaptive, mechanically driven microcirculation outward hypertrophy, potentially due to perturbed shear stress, with potential implications for OSA management.

Binary climate data visuals amplify perceived impact of climate change.	For much of the global population, climate change appears as a slow, gradual shift in daily weather. This leads many to perceive its impacts as minor and results in apathy (the 'boiling frog' effect). How can we convey the urgency of the crisis when its impacts appear so subtle? Here, through a series of large-scale cognitive experiments (N = 799), we find that presenting people with binary climate data (for example, lake freeze history) significantly increases the perceived impact of climate change (Cohen's d = 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.54) compared with continuous data (for example, mean temperature). Computational modelling and follow-up experiments (N = 398) suggest that binary data enhance perceived impact by creating an 'illusion' of sudden shifts. Crucially, our approach does not involve selective data presentation but rather compares different datasets that reflect equivalent trends in climate change over time. These findings, robustly replicated across multiple experiments, provide a cognitive basis for the 'boiling frog' effect and offer a psychologically grounded approach for policymakers and educators to improve climate change communication while maintaining scientific accuracy.

Engineering IL-10 and rapamycin to bind collagen leads to improved anti fibrotic efficacy in lung and kidney fibrosis.	Fibrotic diseases are involved in 45% of deaths in the United States. In particular, fibrosis of the kidney and lung are major public health concerns due to their high prevalence and lack of existing treatment options. Here, we harness the pathophysiological features of fibrotic diseases, namely leaky vasculature and aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) protein deposition (i.e. collagen), to target an anti-fibrotic biologic and a small molecule drug to disease sites of fibrosis, thus improving the therapeutic potential of both the biologic and small molecule in mouse models of both lung and kidney fibrosis. First, we identify and validate two collagen-targeting drug delivery systems that preferentially accumulate in fibrotic organs: von Willebrand Factor's A3 domain (VWF-A3) and decorin-derived collagen-binding peptide-conjugated micelles (CBP-micelles). We then engineer and recombinantly express novel candidate biologic therapies based on the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10: A3-IL-10 and A3-Serum Albumin-IL-10 (A3-SA-IL-10). Simultaneously, we stably encapsulate the potential anti-fibrotic water-insoluble drug, rapamycin, in CBP-micelles. We show that these novel formulations of therapeutics bind to collagen in vitro and that their efficacy in mouse models of lung and kidney fibrosis is improved, compared to free, untargeted drugs. Our results demonstrate that collagen-targeted anti-fibrotic drugs may be next generation therapies of high clinical potential.	Collagen-targeting; Drug delivery; Fibrosis; Interleukin-10; Rapamycin

Surrogate modeling of passive microwave circuits using recurrent neural networks and domain confinement.	Electromagnetic (EM) simulation is widespread in microwave engineering. EM tools ensure evaluation reliability but incur significant expenses. These can be mitigated by employing surrogate modeling methods, especially to expedite design workflows like local/global optimization or uncertainty quantification. However, building accurate surrogates is a daunting task beyond simple cases (low dimensionality, narrow geometry parameter and frequency ranges). This research suggests a new technique for dependable modeling of microwave circuits. Its main ingredient is a recurrent neural network (RNN) with the main architectural components being bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers. These are incorporated to accurately represent frequency relationship within circuit characteristics as well as dependencies between its dimensions and outputs considered as vector-valued functions parameterized by frequency. The network's hyperparameters are adjusted through Bayesian Optimization (BO). Utilization of frequency as a sequential variable handled by RNN is a distinguishing feature of our approach, which leads to the enhancement of dependability and cost efficiency. Another critical factor is dimension- and volume-wise reduction of the model's domain achieved through global sensitivity analysis. It allows for additional and dramatic accuracy improvements without diminishing the surrogate's coverage regarding circuit's operating parameters. Our methodology has been extensively validated using several microstrip structures. The results demonstrate its competitive performance over a range of kernel-based regression techniques and diverse neural networks. The proposed procedure ensures building models of outstanding predictive power while using small training datasets, which is beyond the capabilities of benchmark algorithms.

Warming leads to both earlier and later snowmelt floods over the past 70 years.	"Climate warming reduces snow cover in cold regions, altering snowmelt flood regimes with significant hydrological and ecological consequences. Existing evidence indicates that as climate warms, snowmelt tends to begin earlier in the season, leading to earlier snowmelt floods. Here we show that the timing of snowmelt floods can be either advanced or delayed under warming. Using streamflow observations from 1950-2020 and an event-based analysis that distinguishes flood-generating mechanisms across 2339 Northern Hemisphere, snow-affected catchments, we show that the earlier snowmelt effect can be substantially offset or even reversed by a decelerated snowmelt rate under warming. This results in delayed snowmelt floods in approximately 30% of the catchments, contributing to an overall minor shift on a hemispheric scale (-0.87 ± 2.4 days per decade). Our findings challenge the prevailing ""warming leads to earlier snowmelt floods"" paradigm, revealing a more complex pattern of changes in snowmelt flood in a warming world."

MIRO1 mutation leads to metabolic maladaptation resulting in Parkinson's disease-associated dopaminergic neuron loss.	MIRO1 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein important for mitochondrial distribution, dynamics and bioenergetics. Over the last decade, evidence has pointed to a link between MIRO1 and Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Moreover, a heterozygous MIRO1 mutation (p.R272Q) was identified in a PD patient, from which an iPSC-derived midbrain organoid model was derived, showing MIRO1 mutant-dependent selective loss of dopaminergic neurons. Herein, we use patient-specific iPSC-derived midbrain organoids carrying the MIRO1 p.R272Q mutation to further explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis and metabolic modeling we show that the MIRO1 p.R272Q mutation affects the dopaminergic neuron developmental path leading to metabolic deficits and disrupted neuron-astrocyte metabolic crosstalk, which might represent an important pathogenic mechanism leading to their loss.

Cell cycle disorders in podocytes: an emerging and increasingly recognized phenomenon.	Proteinuria is observed in various kidney diseases and is frequently associated with a compromised glomerular filtration barrier. Podocytes, as a crucial component of this barrier, play an essential role in preserving the kidney's normal filtration function. Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells that typically do not proliferate. However, certain harmful stimuli can trigger podocytes to re-enter the cell cycle. Due to its unique cytoskeletal structure, podocytes are unable to maintain the structure of the foot process and complete cell division at the same time, eventually form binucleated or multinucleated podocytes. Studies have found that podocytes re-entering the cell cycle are more susceptible to injury, and are prone to detachment from the basement membrane or apoptosis, which are accompanied by the widening of foot processes. This eventually leads to podocyte mitotic catastrophe and the development of proteinuria. Podocyte cell cycle disorders have previously been found mainly in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy. In recent years, this phenomenon has been frequently identified in diabetic kidney disease and lupus nephritis. An expanding body of research has begun to investigate the mechanisms underlying podocyte cell cycle disorders, including cell cycle re-entry, cell cycle arrest, and mitotic catastrophe. This review consolidates the existing literature on podocyte cell cycle disorders in renal diseases and summarizes the molecules that trigger podocyte re-entry into the cell cycle, thereby providing new drug targets for mitigating podocyte damage. This is essential for alleviating podocyte injury, reducing proteinuria, and delaying the progression of kidney diseases.

Stressful Life Events and Heart Failure: A Mixed-Method Study to Analyze the Patient's Perspective.	The challenge in heart failure medical practice is to address the clinical and laboratory method integrations for the shared decision-making process in caring for patients and families. Furthermore, stressful life events may worsen outcomes in patients with heart failure. This study aimed to explore patient perceptions regarding cardiac care analyzing the individual needs and features of adverse life event experiences. A mixed-methods design was used in this study. This quantitative research focuses on clinical (medical and psychological) data. Giorgi's phenomenological method was applied to the interview analysis. Qualitative analyses highlighted the role of patient-engagement strategies powered by cardiologists in a personalized approach that favors adherence to complex medical therapies. Active patient involvement and associated engagement based on cardiologists' confidence are focal points for facilitating management-therapy strategies to improve outcomes and reduce the perception of the frailty burden. The quality of therapeutic relationships with cardiologists is a key protective factor for accurate risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making in patients, addressing the potential benefits of therapeutic interventions. In conclusion, the engaged patient contributes to more efficient cardiological care and the personalized patient-centered approach leads to the more efficient 'cure and care' clinical model. In adverse life events, acute psychological and physiological stress responses intensify detrimental outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disorders. Integrative management of physical risks and mental resilience factors in the development of cardiac disease appears to be strategic for patients with a positive quality of life (QoL) and clinical management of heart failure (HF).

Stratum corneum pH and ceramides: Key regulators and biomarkers of skin barrier function in atopic dermatitis.	"The skin, as the outermost layer of the body, serves as a crucial protective barrier against environmental insults while maintaining homeostasis. Atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent eczema and type 2 inflammation, affects a significant global population. The pathophysiology of AD is closely linked to skin barrier dysfunction, which contributes to increased permeability, immune dysregulation, and microbial imbalances. Historically, skin barrier research has centered on the stratum corneum (SC) and intercellular lipids within the epidermis, primarily conceptualized through the ""brick-and-mortar"" model. However, recent advancements have revealed a more intricate interplay among various barrier components. Two key determinants of skin barrier-SC pH and SC ceramides-have gained substantial attention. Elevated SC pH leads to enhanced serine protease activity, impaired lipid metabolism, and microbiome dysbiosis, all of which exacerbate barrier dysfunction and inflammation in AD. Concurrently, alterations in SC ceramide profiles and structures compromise skin barrier function. Emerging evidence underscores the potential of SC pH and ceramides as biomarkers for disease progression and as therapeutic targets for barrier restoration. Advances in lipid analyses and non-invasive pH assessment offer promising prospects for personalized dermatologic interventions. This review explores the complex interactions of SC pH and ceramides in AD pathogenesis, discussing their implications for predicting disease flares, guiding treatment strategies, and identifying novel drug targets.

Genetic Drivers of Quality of Life in Prostate Cancer: An Evaluation of Genetic Polymorphisms and Patient-reported Outcomes in the E3805 CHAARTED trial.	The rs4680 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the COMT gene leads to a reduction in dopamine clearance, resulting in better mood and a decrease in symptoms in noncancer populations, but its influence on quality of life (QOL) during cancer treatment is undefined. We hypothesized that in comparison to wildtype (WT) COMT, the rs4680 SNP is associated with better QOL among men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy ± docetaxel (ADT ± D). In this post hoc analysis, we tested the association between COMT rs4680 status and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (overall QOL), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, and Brief Pain Inventory scores at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo using Fisher's exact test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Blood samples for genotyping were collected before treatment initiation. COMT SNP data were available for 550/790 men. Across the overall cohort, 3-mo pain severity was lower for rs4680 versus WT COMT (0.5 vs 1.25; p = 0.04). In the ADT arm, rs4680 versus WT COMT was associated with better overall QOL at 6 mo (128.9 vs 118.5; p = 0.04), less pain at 3 mo (no pain: 70.4% vs 41.5%; p = 0.01), and less pain interference at 3 mo (no interference: 76% vs 51.3%; p = 0.03), 6 mo (75% vs 48.7%; p = 0.02), and 9 mo (83.3% vs 52%; p = 0.02), with similar fatigue scores. Patients in the ADT + D arm had similar QOL regardless of COMT status. Patients with the COMT rs4680 SNP experienced less pain and better global QOL after starting ADT alone. This is the first study to show that inherited genetic traits may influence treatment tolerability in men with prostate cancer.

Characterizing the diversity of layer 2/3 human neocortical neurons in pediatric epilepsy.	Childhood epilepsy is a common and devastating condition, for which many children still do not have adequate treatment. Some children with drug-resistant epilepsy require surgical excision of epileptogenic brain tissue for seizure control, affording the opportunity to study this tissue ex vivo to interrogate human epileptic neurons for potentially hyperexcitable perturbations in intrinsic electrophysiological properties. In this study, we characterized the diversity of layer L2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons (PNs) in ex vivo brain slices from pediatric patients with epilepsy. We found a remarkable diversity in the firing properties of epileptic L2/3 PNs: five distinct sub-populations were identified. Additionally, we investigated whether the etiology of epilepsy influenced the intrinsic neuronal properties of L2/3 PNs when comparing tissue from patients with epilepsy due to malformations of cortical development (MCDs), other forms of epilepsy (OEs), or with deep-seated tumors. When comparing epileptic with control L2/3 PNs, we observed a decrease in voltage sag and lower maximum firing rates. Moreover, we found that MCD and OE L2/3 PNs were mostly similar indicating that epilepsy etiology may not outweigh the influences of epileptiform activity on L2/3 PN physiology. Lastly, we show that the proconvulsant drug, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), leads to increased AP half-width, reduced firing rate accommodation, and slower AHPs. These changes imply that 4-AP induces an increase in [K

Arsenic (As) and chromium (Cr) are two harmful toxicants as well as carcinogens which can coexist in polluted surface water and groundwater. This coexistence leads to mixture effects in animals including fish. Both of these heavy metals are reported to manifest reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated toxicity. Though individual neurotoxic effects have been reported, their mixture effects, its mechanism and cellular responses against oxidative stress and DNA damages remain unknown. The present study evaluated the individual and mixture effects of As and Cr at their environmentally relevant concentrations in zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain after 15, 30 and 60 days of exposure. Nrf2, a transcription factor is involved in the expressional regulation of enzymes needed to maintain cellular redox homeostasis. This study reported the expressional pattern of Nrf2 and its associated xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme Nqo1 and other markers of oxidative stress such as ROS generation, reduced glutathione level, lipid peroxidation and catalase activity. Increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, glutathione level, and catalase activity indicated oxidative stress in exposed groups. In addition, this study revealed expressional alterations of neurotoxicity marker (ache), DNA repair (ogg1, apex1, creb1, polb, mlh1, msh2 and msh6) and tumor suppressor (p53, brca2) genes. Results of ROS generation, MDA level, histopathological analysis, gene expression and immunofluorescence study confirmed that As and Cr did not show antagonistic effects in combination rather indicated additive effects which was dose-dependent but not always linear.

Microplastics (MPs) are a rising global concern, infiltrating marine ecosystems and food sources, including seaweed, which is widely consumed. This review examines the prevalence of MPs in seaweed, their role as pathways for MPs to enter marine food webs, and the potential risks to marine organisms and human health. Findings indicate that it contributes up to 45.5% of total dietary microplastic (MP) intake through seaweed, with particularly high levels in South Asian regions, which is concerning. Factors such as seaweeds morphology, surface properties, epibionts, and environmental conditions influence MP uptake. Microplastic contamination in seaweed leads to bioaccumulation and biomagnification, affecting marine organisms through oxidative stress, growth disruption, immune issues, and metabolic disturbances. Seaweeds bioaccumulate heavy metals from seawater, and microplastics (MPs) attract these metals, increasing toxicity might enter food chain posing health risk. Simple methods like water washing can reduce MPs on seaweed surfaces. However, in this case, innovative detection methods and advanced removal technologies are still underexplored. Similarly, Microplastic (MP) contamination presents economic risks to the global seaweed industry, valued at USD 7.0 billion in 2023, with exports reaching 819,100 tonnes worth USD 3.21 billion. By 2024, the industry, dominated by Asian countries, had grown to USD 22.13 billion, but MP contamination threatens further expansion by undermining consumer confidence, reducing market value, and increasing regulatory scrutiny. Asia accounts for 47.9% of global seafood MP contamination, the economic repercussions could be substantial. Future research should explore the long-term effects of environmental aging on microplastic debris in seaweeds related marine organisms, emphasizing food security and human health. Studies should also focus on the toxicological effects of micro- and Nano plastics (MNPs) from seaweed-based contaminants in human food consumption. Robust government initiatives and policies promoting a circular economy are crucial for effective management.	Detection methods; Food Safety; Implications; Microplastics; Seaweeds

Corneal transparency is critical for optimal visual function, and corneal neovascularization represents the primary cause of visual impairment globally. Recent studies have identified the transcription factor BMAL1 as a significant regulator of angiogenesis. However, its specific role and underlying mechanisms in endothelial cell apoptosis remain inadequately understood. This study seeks to elucidate the role and underlying mechanisms of BMAL1 in endothelial cell apoptosis by employing genetic modification, alkali-burned mouse corneal neovascularization models, lentiviral transfection, proteomic analysis, and other complementary methodologies. Our results showed that BMAL1 expression is significantly elevated in corneal neovascularization induced by alkali burn and removal of Bmal1 in endothelial cells resulted in the suppression of corneal neovascularization in alkali burn mouse models. In vivo experiments have demonstrated that the knockout of Bmal1 in endothelial cells leads to an increase in endothelial cell apoptosis. Complementary in vitro studies revealed that overexpression of BMAL1 in endothelial cells inhibits apoptosis, while knockdown of BMAL1 promotes apoptosis. Proteomic analysis identified STAT6 as a downstream target of BMAL1 involved in the regulation of endothelial cell apoptosis. Further cell salvage experiments confirmed that BMAL1 modulates endothelial cell apoptosis through the regulation of STAT6 expression. Finally, the results of dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that BMAL1 exerts transcriptional repressive effects on the promoter bound by STAT6. This study elucidates the novel role and mechanism of BMAL1 in the regulation of angiogenesis and endothelial cell apoptosis, thereby identifying a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of vascular diseases such as corneal neovascularization.

CAPRIN1/TYMS/MTHFD2 axis promotes EMT process in nasopharyngeal carcinoma development.	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a type of malignant tumor occurring in the nasopharynx. It frequently leads to treatment failure after metastasis, often resulting from epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) is a key enzyme involved in DNA synthesis and replication. Currently, the role of TYMS and its mechanism of upstream and downstream in EMT of NPC is unclear. NPC cell lines HK-1 and C666-1 were used in this study. Lentivirus carrying TYMS knockdown and overexpressed plasmids were used to regulate TYMS expression. Cell migration and invasion were examined using the wound-healing and Transwell assays, respectively. C666-1 cells were injected into the axilla and tail vein of mice to form subcutaneous tumors and construct lung metastasis model, respectively. RNA immunoprecipitation assay was used to examine the interaction between protein and mRNA. RNA-seq was performed to explore the downstream regulatory mechanism of TYMS. TYMS was highly expressed in NPC tissues. TYMS silencing and upregulation inhibited and promoted EMT processes in NPC cells, respectively, as demonstrated by the expression of EMT-related proteins, including E-cadherin, Slug, MMP2, and MMP9. Cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein-1 (CAPRIN1), a protein bound with TYMS mRNA, promoted the EMT process in NPC cells. Meanwhile, TYMS knockdown reversed the effect of CAPRIN1 overexpression. Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) was down-regulated following TYMS silencing. MTHFD2 knockdown abolished the effect of TYMS overexpression. CAPRIN1/TYMS/MTHFD2 axis drives the EMT process and thus promotes NPC development, which is a promising target in therapy and adjuvant therapy of NPC.

Plasmalogens are a distinct subclass of glycerophospholipids that exhibit unique structural features, notably possessing a vinyl ether linkage at the sn1 position of the glycerol backbone. These specialised lipids play crucial roles in various biological functions. Although the biosynthetic pathway of plasmalogens has been well-characterised, their catabolism remains less studied. In this study, we investigated the impact of global and tissue-specific loss-of-function of a plasmalogen catabolising enzyme, lysoplasmalogenase (TMEM86B), on circulatory and tissue lipidomes. We generated both global and hepatocyte-specific Tmem86b knockout mice using cre-loxP technology. Mice with homozygous global inactivation of Tmem86b (Tmem86b KO mice) were viable and did not display any marked phenotypic abnormalities. Tmem86b KO mice demonstrated significantly elevated levels of the plasmalogens, alkenylphosphatidylethanolamine (PE(P)) and alkenylphosphatidylcholine (PC(P)), as well as lysoplasmalogens, in the plasma, liver, and natural killer cells compared to their wild-type counterparts. The endogenous alkenyl chain composition of plasmalogens remained unaltered in Tmem86b KO mice. Consistent with the global knockout findings, hepatocyte-specific Tmem86b knockout mice also exhibited increased plasmalogen levels in the plasma and liver compared to their floxed control counterparts. Overall, our findings shed light on the role of Tmem86b in plasmalogen catabolism, demonstrating how its ablation leads to an increase in select tissues and cells. This study enhances our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing plasmalogen metabolism and highlights the potential of targeting Tmem86b to therapeutically raise plasmalogen levels.

Spin-exchange induced spillover on poor man's majoranas in minimal Kitaev chains.	The ``Poor Man's Majoranas'' (PMMs) [Phys. Rev. B 86, 134528 (2012)] devoid of topological protection can ``spill over'' from one edge into another of the minimal Kitaev chain when perturbed electrostatically. As aftermath, this leads to a delocalized Majorana fermion (MF) at both the edges. Additionally, according to recent differential conductance measurements in a pair of superconducting and spinless quantum dots (QDs), such a PMM picture was brought to reality [Nature 614, 445 (2023) and Nature 630, 329 (2024)]. Based on this scenario, we propose the spillover of the PMM when its QD is exchange coupled to a quantum spin $S$. We show that if this QD is perturbed by the exchange coupling $J$, solely the half $2S+1$ $(2S+2)$ of the fine structure stays explicit for a fermionic (bosonic) $S.$ Concurrently, the other half squeezes itself as the delocalized MF zero-mode. Particularly, turning-off the superconductivity the multiplicity $2S+1$ holds regardless the spin statistics. Meanwhile, the PMM spillover induced by $J$ becomes a statistics dependent effect. Hence, our findings contribute to the comprehension of spin-phenomena interplay with superconductivity in minimal Kitaev chains, offering insights&#xD;for future quantum computing devices hosting PMMs.	Crossed Andreev Reflection; Green´s Functions; Minimal Kitaev Chains; Poor Man´s Majoranas; Quantum Dots; Spectral and Quantum Transport approaches; Spin-Exchange Coupling

Biallelic pathogenic variants in TRMT1 disrupt tRNA modification and induce a neurodevelopmental disorder.	The post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs plays a crucial role in tRNA structure and function. Pathogenic variants in tRNA-modification enzymes have been implicated in a wide range of human neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. However, the molecular basis for many of these disorders remains unknown. Here, we describe a comprehensive cohort of 43 individuals from 31 unrelated families with bi-allelic variants in tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1). These individuals present with a neurodevelopmental disorder universally characterized by developmental delay and intellectual disability, accompanied by variable behavioral abnormalities, epilepsy, and facial dysmorphism. The identified variants include ultra-rare TRMT1 variants, comprising missense and predicted loss-of-function variants, which segregate with the observed clinical pathology. Our findings reveal that several variants lead to mis-splicing and a consequent loss of TRMT1 protein accumulation. Moreover, cells derived from individuals harboring TRMT1 variants exhibit a deficiency in tRNA modifications catalyzed by TRMT1. Molecular analysis reveals distinct regions of TRMT1 required for tRNA-modification activity and binding. Notably, depletion of Trmt1 protein in zebrafish is sufficient to induce developmental and behavioral phenotypes along with gene-expression changes associated with disrupted cell cycle, immune response, and neurodegenerative disorders. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that loss of TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications leads to intellectual disability and provides insight into the molecular underpinnings of tRNA-modification deficiency caused by pathogenic TRMT1 variants.

Antioxidant system alterations and oxidative stress caused by polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in exposed biota: a review.	Contamination of aquatic and terrestrial organisms by Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), emerging contaminants, is widespread, as these compounds are present in water, soil, air, and food, owing to their environmental persistence. PFAS exposure induces biochemical process alterations associated with the disruption of the antioxidant defense system in several species. This review aims to discuss how PFAS-induced antioxidant system alterations lead to changes in biochemical processes in different organisms exposed to these pollutants. This disruption, then leads to an imbalance in antioxidant defense systems, contributing to the formation of reactive oxidative species (ROS), which, in turn, can be exacerbate oxidative stress, induce cellular damage, enhance lipid peroxidation, destabilize lysosomal membranes, and cause genotoxic effects, ultimately compromising DNA integrity. In acute tests, PFAS have led to mortality, growth inhibition, diminished behavioral and locomotor abilities, and reproductive impairment. PFAS-induced effects differ with varying species or types of substances, and further bioaccumulation through food chains exacerbates environmental contamination, carrying considerable risks. These findings demonstrate the complex and enduring impact of PFAS on environmental health, emphasizing the importance of this review in corroborating studies on sub-lethal toxicity in exposed organisms and how these effects reflect on the environment.

Coupling-induced tunability of characteristic frequency, bandwidth and gain of artificial hair cells.	Drawing inspiration from nature, we develop bio-inspired acoustic sensors with integrated signal processing capabilities to (i) close the performance gap between the human hearing and machine hearing and (ii) test models on biological hearing. Particularly important is thereby the combination of frequency decomposition with nonlinear (compressive) amplification of the sound signals. Here, the question arises, how the frequency resolution of 0.1-0.4%, the large gain and the coverage of the large frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz can be obtained with a modest number of 3000 inner hair cells as transducers without missing tones. To solve this issue, it was hypothesized that the cochlea can be modeled as coupled critical oscillators. We study experimentally and theoretically the effects of coupling critical oscillators using bio-inspired acoustic sensors, which are based-on microelectromechanical system (MEMS) resonators with a high-quality factor and a resonance frequency set by the geometry. Using electronic feedback, these resonators act like critical oscillators tuned near Andronov-Hopf bifurcation point. If output-signal coupling is added, three different bifurcation points are generated. Tuning the system close to one of these bifurcation points leads to a highly tunable behavior and sound pressure dependent sensitivity that is compressive in nature. In this case, the response frequency of the sensor system can be shifted by tuning the control parameter for bifurcation, allowing to cover larger bandwidths with one sensor pair while retaining high quality factors. Furthermore, tuning coupling and feedback strength, bandwidth and gain of each sensor can be adapted as needed. Using these effects, an adaptive filter bank to model the cochlear functionality and adaptation can be build. Since efferent feedback can tune the response of outer hair cells and thus inner hair cells and basilar membrane as well, the question arises if such tuning mechanisms can be observed in the mammalian cochlea as well.

Joint semi-supervised and contrastive learning enables domain generalization and multi-domain segmentation.	Despite their effectiveness, current deep learning models face challenges with images coming from different domains with varying appearance and content. We introduce SegCLR, a versatile framework designed to segment images across different domains, employing supervised and contrastive learning simultaneously to effectively learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. We demonstrate the superior performance of SegCLR through a comprehensive evaluation involving three diverse clinical datasets of 3D retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images, for the slice-wise segmentation of fluids with various network configurations and verification across 10 different network initializations. In an unsupervised domain adaptation context, SegCLR achieves results on par with a supervised upper-bound model trained on the intended target domain. Notably, we discover that the segmentation performance of SegCLR framework is marginally impacted by the abundance of unlabeled data from the target domain, thereby we also propose an effective domain generalization extension of SegCLR, known also as zero-shot domain adaptation, which eliminates the need for any target domain information. This shows that our proposed addition of contrastive loss in standard supervised training for segmentation leads to superior models, inherently more generalizable to both in- and out-of-domain test data. We additionally propose a pragmatic solution for SegCLR deployment in realistic scenarios with multiple domains containing labeled data. Accordingly, our framework pushes the boundaries of deep-learning based segmentation in multi-domain applications, regardless of data availability - labeled, unlabeled, or nonexistent.

We examine the impact of minimum wage increases on the overall self-reported health and subjective well-being of low-skilled workers using the Gallup World Poll from 2009 to 2020. We identify effects using within-country changes over time and cross-country variations in the timing and intensity of minimum wage increases across 87 countries. Our findings suggest that minimum wage increases benefit health and certain dimensions of subjective well-being. Specifically, we estimate a range of specifications and find that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage leads to an increase in self-reported health ranging from 0 % to 1 % and an increase in satisfaction with the standard of living between 1 % and 6 %, at the outcome means. Minimum wage increases are linked to higher incomes, a lower likelihood of overtime work, enhanced social interactions, and more positive daily experiences. These benefits are especially significant in countries with stronger rule of law, among male workers, and for individuals in nations with free and universal healthcare access. A series of sensitivity and placebo tests confirm the robustness of these findings.	Gallup world Poll; Minimum wage; Self-reported health; Subjective well-being

F-wave sway in paroxysmal and chronic atrial fibrillation.	Vectorcardiography (VCG) can evaluate the vector loops of electrocardiographic waves, being a time-spatial representation of the heart vector into the three orthonormal leads. During atrial fibrillation (AF), F waves reflect the disorganized depolarization of the atria, replacing the organized P wave. Usually, paroxysmal AF (PAF) spontaneously terminates, differently from chronic AF (CAF), possibly due to the still-preserved main direction of the P-wave vector loop. To investigate this hypothesis, this study aims to evaluate the similarities between the P-wave vector loop and F-wave vector sway in subjects affected by PAF and CAF. Overall, 10-s VCG were acquired from 10 healthy (HEA) subjects showing normal sinus rhythm, 10 subjects affected by PAF (one during normal sinus rhythm and one during AF), and 10 subjects affected by CAF. P waves were extracted using ECGdeli software, while F waves were extracted after QRST cancellation. Ellipse axes and eccentricities were calculated as the root mean square of VCG components and the ratio between axes, respectively. Overall, 84 beats of HEA, 205 beats of PAF (89 beats during normal sinus rhythm and 116 during fibrillation), and 103 beats of CAF were analyzed. Distributions of axes and eccentricities of PAF are not statistically different (P-value>0.05) than normal sinus rhythm but features related to the Z axis of CAF were statistically lower than PAF (P-value〈10	Atrial depolarization; Atrial fibrillation; Fibrillatory waves; Vectorcardiography

Automation of hospital workflows using international standards: A case study with imaging exams.	Hospital workflow automation holds paramount importance in modern healthcare systems. By streamlining complex processes, it is possible to enhance operational efficiency and patient care. Automated workflows aligned with open standards, such as openEHR, enable accurate data capture, seamless communication, and timely task execution among healthcare professionals. This leads to reduced errors, improved patient outcomes, and optimized resource utilization. This study aims to advance knowledge in healthcare workflow automation by improving a Portuguese hospital's medical imaging exams circuit through the implementation of clinical standards. Specifically, the study explores how openEHR specifications, particularly the Task Planning component, can be applied to streamline workflows and enhance interoperability. A case study research design was selected to examine the imaging exams circuit in a Portuguese hospital, enabling detailed observation of system implementation and its effects. The focus was on implementing openEHR's Task Planning specification, along with forms and decision rules, to achieve comprehensive workflow automation. Following implementation, data from over 6800 imaging exam requests were analyzed, demonstrating health professionals' willingness to adopt the automated tools. A significant reduction in waiting times for outsourcing management was observed, with fewer waiting days on average in 2022 compared to 2019. This study shows the development of a new approach to the imaging exams workflow using the openEHR specifications achieving an automated process with structured data generation. The authors believe that the developed system represents an important step towards efficient knowledge discovery from the registry of high-quality and structured data.

The effect of toluene exposure on the fine structure of motor cortex pyramidal neurons in different aged rats: An electron microscopy study.	Toluene is known to affect the central nervous system. When inhaled, it can rapidly enter the bloodstream and reach the brain. Exposure to toluene may have a specific effect on pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex, as these neurons play a critical role in the control of voluntary motor movements. The effects of toluene on neurons may vary depending on several factors, including the level and duration of exposure, the age of the exposed individual, and individual susceptibility. The effects of toluene on the morphology of neurons in the motor cortex were studied in adolescent (P28-30) and adult (P110-120) male rats of different ages. Experimental rats were exposed to toluene vapor at a concentration of 2000 ppm for 3-4 min per day for 40 days. The number of pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex and their fine structure were studied. The results showed that in adults there are fewer changes in the fine structure of neurons, mainly affecting the mitochondria, where individual cristae are damaged. The changes were much more pronounced in rats that inhaled toluene at the age of one month. Here there were changes in the structure of synapses, severe damages of mitochondria, which leads to degenerative changes in neurons and ultimately to neuronal death.

Harnessing the modulation of redox homeostasis represents a promising anticancer strategy. Here, we design and evaluate Se-SN38, a prodrug of the camptothecin (CPT) derivative 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) with a cyclic five-membered diselenide moiety for redox-triggered activation. We demonstrate that Se-SN38 exhibits superior cytotoxicity in various cancer cell lines over the parent drug SN38 or the control prodrug S-SN38, a sulfur analogue of Se-SN38. This increased potency is attributed to the efficient release of SN38 and induction of oxidative stress, as demonstrated by a significant rise in reactive oxygen species production, along with a marked depletion of cellular total thiols and a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio. Furthermore, Se-SN38 treatment leads to inhibition of thioredoxin reductase activity, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, and induction of DNA damage, culminating in apoptosis. These findings suggest that Se-SN38 represents a promising strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of CPT derivatives by exploiting the unique redox-active properties of cyclic five-membered diselenide to induce oxidative stress and apoptosis.

Irreversible Oxygen Redox Enables Lithium Extraction from Ternary Lithium-Ion Battery Cathodes in Water.	Developing a low-cost and environmentally friendly method for lithium extraction is essential for the efficient recycling of spent lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathodes. Current technologies, such as solvent extraction/precipitation and electrochemical processes, rely on anion- or cation-rich extraction agents and necessitate further purification, leading to high energy consumption and waste pollution. Here, we demonstrate that applying mechanical treatment on ternary LIB cathodes enables water to extract lithium from the cathode materials under mild conditions, achieving Li extraction efficiencies of 99.4% for LiNi

The length of G1 phase is an essential determinant of H3K27me3 landscape across diverse cell types.	"Stem cells have lower facultative heterochromatin as defined by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) compared to differentiated cells. However, the mechanisms underlying these differential H3K27me3 levels remain elusive. Because H3K27me3 levels are diluted 2-fold in every round of replication and then restored through the rest of the cell cycle, we reasoned that the cell cycle length could be a key regulator of total H3K27me3 levels. Here, we propose that a short G1 phase restricts H3K27me3 levels in stem cells. To test this model, we determined changes to H3K27me3 levels in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) globally and at specific loci upon G1 phase lengthening - accomplished by thymidine block or growth in the absence of serum (with the ""2i medium""). H3K27me3 levels in mESCs increase with G1 arrest when grown in serum and in 2i medium. Additionally, we observed via CUT&RUN and ChIP-seq that regions that gain H3K27me3 in G1 arrest and 2i media overlap, supporting our model of G1 length as a critical regulator of the stem cell epigenome. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inverse effect - that G1 shortening in differentiated human HEK293 cells results in a loss of H3K27me3 levels. Finally, in human tumor cells with extreme H3K27me3 loss, lengthening of the G1 phase leads to H3K27me3 recovery despite the presence of the dominant negative, sub-stoichiometric H3.K27M mutation. Our results indicate that G1 length is an essential determinant of H3K27me3 landscapes across diverse cell types."

Cross-species analysis of the nuclease Artemis highlights its evolving function in domesticating RAG-like transposons and residues that are crucial for activity.	The discovery of the ProtoRAG transposon in lancelets revealed that V(D)J recombination originates from the Recombination activating gene-like (RAGL) transposon. Analogous to the vertebrate RAG complex, the RAGL transposase nicks host flanking DNA and leads to the formation of hairpin ends. Here, we showed that the Artemis nuclease, which is capable of resolving DNA hairpin ends generated during V(D)J recombination, is also responsible for unraveling ProtoRAG-mediated DNA hairpin ends. Notably, like the RAGL transposon, Artemis originated from the eukaryotic common ancestor. By tracing the evolving function of Artemis from cephalochordates to vertebrates, we revealed the lineage specific allele polymorphism of lancelet Artemis and uncovered an increased activity on hairpin DNA opening in vertebrate Artemis. Additionally, the evolutionarily conserved LYCS motif in Artemis β6, which may be associated with disease, is demonstrated to be crucial for its function. Overall, this study highlights the evolving function of Artemis, identifies novel critical residues, and provides new insights into the evolution of RAG-mediated recombination and the clinical therapy of Artemis deficient disease.

Resveratrol decreases extracellular traps (ETs) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (NB4) cells.	Activated neutrophils can create structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs/ETs) consisting of nuclear components and granules. The ETOsis phenomenon leads to activating the platelets and coagulation factors. Accordingly, coagulation and fibrinolysis can be promoted. Resveratrol (RSV) is a botanical antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and anti-leukemia effects. The present study was conducted to assess the effect of RSV on the occurrence of ETOsis in the NB4 cell line. Human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line (NB4) were stimulated and treated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and RSV, respectively. Sytox green and a fluorescent microscope were used to assess the ETOsis in NB4 cells. Furthermore, the expression level of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) gene and the occurrence of ETOsis in NB4 cells were evaluated by real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Moreover, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was utilized to measure tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) cytokine. Following treatment with RSV, a significant decrease in PAD4 gene expression and TNF-α cytokine concentration in the supernatant of NB4 cell line culture medium was observed. Besides, the amount of ETOsis in the NB4 cells treated with LPS and RSV decreased. The findings demonstrated that RSV can inhibit the process of ETOsis in NB4 cells. By inhibiting the process of ETOsis, RSV may be able to reduce the bleeding and, consequently, the failure after treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients.

The transcription factor MYB30 promotes iron homeostasis by maintaining the stability of the FIT transcription factor.	Iron (Fe) is a vital nutrient for the growth and development of plants. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the bHLH transcription factor FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT) plays a pivotal role in regulating the response to Fe deficiency. Our study reveals that the R2R3-MYB transcription factor MYB30 is a positive regulator of the Fe-deficiency response by regulating FIT stability. Plants with loss-of-function mutations in MYB30 exhibit pronounced Fe-deficiency symptoms and diminished Fe uptake, while overexpression of MYB30 leads to the opposite effects. We have discovered that MYB30 interacts with BRUTUS LIKE1 (BTSL1) and BTSL2, two partially redundant E3 ubiquitin ligases that negatively regulate the Fe-deficiency response. MYB30 binds to the C-terminal region of BTSL1 through its MYB DNA-binding domain, thereby safeguarding FIT from BTSL1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in FIT accumulation for Fe deficiency response. In summary, our research uncovers the role of the transcription factor MYB30 as a regulator of FIT stability, which in turn modulates Fe homeostasis in plants in response to Fe deficiency.

Zinc Oxide-Copper Sulfide Nanozyme Hydrogels for Bone Defect Repair by Modulating the Bone Immune Microenvironment and Promoting Osteogenesis/Angiogenesis.	Bone defects caused by trauma, tumors, or infections pose significant challenges to clinical treatment because of the complex pathological microenvironment they create. Elevated levels of inflammatory factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the defect site disrupt the bone immune microenvironment, impeding bone regeneration. Concurrently, the vascular damage frequently associated with bone defects leads to hypoxia, further complicating therapeutic efforts. Although bone grafting remains a primary clinical approach, its efficacy is limited by these adverse conditions. In this study, a ZnO-CuS/F127 nanozyme hydrogel with multiple enzymatic activities was manufactured for bone defect repair via the modulation of the bone immune microenvironment and the promotion of osteo-/angiogenesis, which was accomplished via the encapsulation of ZnO-CuS nanoflowers synthesized via calcination into the F127 hydrogel matrix. ZnO-CuS bimetallic nanoenzymes exhibit robust catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase-like activities, enabling effective scavenging of diverse ROS species	ZnO–CuS/F127; bone defect repair; immunomodulation; multiple enzymatic activities; promoting osteo-/angiogenesis

Quantitative Changes in the Proteome of Chronically Inflamed Lacrimal Glands From a Sjögren's Disease Animal Model.	The lacrimal gland (LG) is the major source of aqueous tears, and insufficient LG secretion leads to aqueous-deficient dry eye (ADDE) disease. To provide a foundational description of LG's protein expression patterns, we prepared protein extracts of LGs from a wild-type and an ADDE mouse model and analyzed the proteome by quantitative mass spectrometry. LGs were isolated from an ADDE mouse model, male non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and control wild-type BALB/c mice (n = 6 each). Protein samples were prepared in urea-based lysis buffer and protein concentrations determined by the BCA method. The equivalent of 200 µg protein were tryptically digested and analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Proteins were identified and quantified using the PEAKS X bioinformatics suite. Downstream differential protein expression analysis was performed using the MS-DAP R package. Selected significantly differentially expressed and detected proteins were subjected to spatial expression analysis using immunohistochemistry. Cumulatively, the LC-MS/MS-based proteomics analyses of the murine LG samples identified a total of 31,932 peptide sequences resulting in 2617 protein identifications at a 1% false discovery rate at the peptide and protein level. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed a separation of NOD and BALB/c samples. Overall, protein diversity was consistently higher in NOD samples. After applying global peptide filter criteria and peptide-to-protein rollup, 1750 remaining proteins were subjected to differential expression analysis using the MSqRob algorithm, which identified 580 proteins with statistically significant expression differences. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD060937. At the cellular level, the up- and downregulation of select proteins were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Our data suggest that chronic inflammation leads to significant alterations in the LG proteome. Ongoing studies aim to identify potentially unique, inflammation-induced proteins that could be amenable to pharmacological modulation.

Fatal ingestion of firecracker in borderline personality disorder: suicide or not?	Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a mental health condition marked by intense emotions, unstable relationships, and a distorted self-image, which often leads to impulsive and self-destructive behaviors. Individuals with BPD frequently engage in deliberate foreign body ingestion (DFBI), a behavior that can result in severe outcomes if dangerous objects are ingested. Herein, we present a case of 45-year-old man with a history of BPD that was found in his apartment with fatal head injuries caused by the explosion of a firecracker in his mouth. Besides extensive head injuries that undoubtedly led to lethal outcome, autopsy revealed a sewing needle deeply embedded in a cardiac muscle, with fibrinous deposits suggesting that its ingestion occurred prior to the fatal incident. Such cases are crucial because they highlight the forensic significance of autopsy findings. By integrating autopsy findings with clinical data and other relevant case circumstances, valuable information can be obtained regarding the cause and manner of death. This case underscores the importance of thorough forensic investigation in cases of unusual self-harm to accurately determine intent and underlying factors.

Genetic diversity of leaf photosynthesis under fluctuating light conditions among temperate japonica rice varieties.	Under field conditions, solar radiation on a crop canopy fluctuates according to clouds, wind, and self-shading. The slower response of photosynthesis compared with the rate of irradiation changes leads to loss of photosynthetic carbon gain. Although some genetic differences in the rate of photosynthetic induction have been reported, the diversity among rice varieties is largely unknown. Here we evaluated genetic variation in the response of photosynthesis to a step increase in light intensity among 166 temperate japonica varieties including landraces and modern varieties. Large genetic variation in photosynthetic induction and less evidence of improvement across modern breeding programmes were acknowledged. In the correlation analysis between physiological traits for all varieties, the efficiency of non-stomatal processes was the major factor affecting the rate of induction. The landrace Aikokumochi, which has intermediate photosynthetic capacity, showed rapid photosynthetic induction-eight times that of the slowest variety. This was attributed to smaller non-stomatal limitation in the initial phase of induction and smaller stomatal limitation in the later phase than in reference varieties. Aikokumochi also had a greater photosynthetic CO2 gain without reduced water use efficiency under repeated fluctuating light. These findings demonstrate the importance of genetic resources to improve photosynthesis while maintaining water use efficiency under fluctuating light conditions.

Advances in Leaf Plant Bioactive Compounds: Modulation of Chronic Inflammation Related to Obesity.	Over the years, there has been a tendency for an increase in global obesity. The World Health Organization's (WHO) 2024 report states that in 2019, more than one billion people were obese, and this condition was responsible for five million deaths, being that obesity is more prevalent among adults compared to adolescents and children. Obesity is a chronic disease characterized by alterations in adipose tissue. When excessive food is consumed and energy expenditure is low, adipose tissue undergoes hypertrophy and hyperplasia. This process activates B cells and induces the transition of anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages into pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages. B cells, acting as inflammatory mediators, stimulate pro-inflammatory CD8+ T cells, and promote macrophage infiltration into tissues. This condition triggers inflammation, increases oxidative stress, and ultimately leads to cellular death. During inflammation, an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs along with a decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokines. By contrast, the increase of oxidative stress is related to an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidation of biomolecules, and a decrease in antioxidants. This mechanism for obesity can be mitigated through several healthy lifestyle changes, primarily including regular physical activity and healthy eating. These factors help reduce pro-inflammatory mediators and ROS, lowering inflammation and oxidative stress. Therefore, this review article focuses on studying the bioactive compounds present in the edible leaves of	anti-obesity capacity; bioactive compounds; chronic inflammation and oxidative stress; leaves; obesity

The Cause-Effect Model of Master Sex Determination Gene Acquisition and the Evolution of Sex Chromosomes.	The canonical model of vertebrate sex chromosome evolution predicts a one-way trend toward degradation. However, most sex chromosomes in lower vertebrates are homomorphic. Recent progress in studies of sex determination has resulted in the discovery of more than 30 master sex determination (MSD) genes, most of which are from teleost fish. An analysis of MSD gene acquisition, recombination suppression, and sex chromosome-specific sequences revealed correlations in the modes of MSD gene acquisition and the evolution of sex chromosomes. Sex chromosomes remain homomorphic with MSD genes acquired by simple mutations, gene duplications, allelic variations, or neofunctionalization; in contrast, they become heteromorphic with MSD genes acquired by chromosomal inversion, fusion, and fission. There is no recombination suppression with sex chromosomes carrying MSD genes gained through simple mutations. In contrast, there is extensive recombination suppression with sex chromosomes carrying MSD genes gained through chromosome inversion. There is limited recombination suppression with sex chromosomes carrying MSD genes gained through transposition or translocation. We propose a cause-effect model that predicts sex chromosome evolution as a consequence of the acquisition modes of MSD genes, which explains the evolution of sex chromosomes in various vertebrates. A key factor determining the trend of sex chromosome evolution is whether non-homologous regions are created during the acquisition of MSD genes. Chromosome inversion creates inversely homologous but directly non-homologous sequences, which lead to recombination suppression but retain recombination potential. Over time, recurrent recombination in the inverted regions leads to the formation of strata and may cause the degradation of sex chromosomes. Depending on the nature of deletions in the inverted regions, sex chromosomes may evolve with dosage compensation, or the selective retention of haplo-insufficient genes may be used as an alternative strategy.	chromosome inversion; master sex determination gene; recombination suppression; sex chromosome evolution; sex determination; sex differentiation

Oral Sheep Milk-Derived Exosome Therapeutics for	Cadmium (Cd) contamination in plants and soil poses significant risks to livestock, particularly sheep. Cd exposure often leads to severe gastrointestinal diseases in sheep that are difficult to treat. Milk-derived exosomes, particularly those from sheep milk (SM-Exo), have shown potential in treating gastrointestinal disorders, though their efficacy in Cd-induced colitis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of SM-Exo in a Cd-induced colitis model. Hu sheep were exposed to Cd, and their fecal microbiota were collected to prepare bacterial solutions for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mice. The changes in gut microbiota and gene expression were analyzed through microbiome and transcriptomics.

Autophagy and Its Association with Macrophages in Clonal Hematopoiesis Leading to Atherosclerosis.	Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by lipid accumulation and immune cell infiltration, is linked to plaque formation and cardiovascular events. While traditionally associated with lipid metabolism and endothelial dysfunction, recent research highlights the roles of autophagy and clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in its pathogenesis. Autophagy, a cellular process crucial for degrading damaged components, regulates macrophage homeostasis and inflammation, both of which are pivotal in atherosclerosis. In macrophages, autophagy influences lipid metabolism, cytokine regulation, and oxidative stress, helping to prevent plaque instability. Defective autophagy exacerbates inflammation, impairs cholesterol efflux, and accelerates disease progression. Additionally, autophagic processes in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells further contribute to atherosclerotic pathology. Recent studies also emphasize the interplay between autophagy and CH, wherein somatic mutations in genes like	atherosclerosis; chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA); clonal hematopoiesis (CH); inflammatory; macrophage; programmed cell death

Reactive Oxygen Species as a Common Pathological Link Between Alcohol Use Disorder and Alzheimer's Disease with Therapeutic Implications.	Chronic alcohol consumption leads to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), driving oxidative stress that contributes to both alcohol use disorder (AUD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review explores how ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation serve as shared pathological mechanisms linking these conditions. We highlight the role of alcohol-induced oxidative damage in exacerbating neurodegeneration and compare ROS-related pathways in AUD and AD. Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies, including mitochondrial antioxidants and inflammasome inhibitors, that target oxidative stress to mitigate neurodegeneration. Understanding these overlapping mechanisms may provide new insights for preventing and treating ROS-driven neurodegenerative disorders.

Downregulation and Hypermethylation of Vitamin D Receptor in Lumbar Disc Degeneration.	Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) is a common musculoskeletal disorder that leads to chronic pain and functional impairment. Recent studies have suggested that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays a key part in regulating matrix metabolism, inflammation, and apoptosis in intervertebral discs (IVDs). The objective of this study was to examine cytokine expression and DNA methylation status of the VDR gene in blood leukocytes and lumbar disc tissues from patients with varying degrees of LDD severity. We aimed to explore correlations between VDR expression, methylation status, and clinical parameters such as pain intensity and functional disability. We conducted a prospective case-control study including 50 participants 35 LDD patients and 15 lumbar disc herniation (LDH) controls. Blood and lumbar disc tissue samples were collected for RNA and DNA extraction, followed by quantitative real-time PCR for gene expression and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction for VDR promoter methylation analysis. Serum and nucleus pulposus (NP) VDR protein levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clinical parameters, including pain intensity (NRS) and functional disability (ODI), were assessed. LDD patients exhibited significantly lower VDR mRNA expression in both blood leukocytes and NP tissue compared to controls (	expression; lumbar disc degeneration; methylation; severity; vitamin D receptor

VMP1 Constitutive Expression in Mice Dampens Pancreatic and Systemic Histopathological Damage in an Experimental Model of Severe Acute Pancreatitis.	Acute pancreatitis (AP) an inflammatory condition caused by the premature activation of pancreatic proteases, leads to organ damage, systemic inflammation, and multi-organ failure. Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) has high morbidity and mortality, affecting the liver, kidneys, and lungs. Autophagy maintains pancreatic homeostasis, with VMP1-mediated selective autophagy (zymophagy) preventing intracellular zymogen activation and acinar cell death. This study examines the protective role of VMP1 (Vacuole Membrane Protein 1)-induced autophagy using ElaI-VMP1 transgenic mice in a necrohemorrhagic SAP model (Hartwig's model). ElaI-VMP1 mice show significantly reduced pancreatic injury, including lower necrosis, edema, and inflammation, compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Biochemical markers (lactate dehydrogenase-LDH-, amylase, and lipase) and histopathology confirm that VMP1 expression mitigates pancreatic damage. Increased zymophagy negatively correlates with acinar necrosis, reinforcing its protective role. Beyond the pancreas, ElaI-VMP1 mice exhibit preserved liver, kidney, and lung histology, indicating reduced systemic organ damage. The liver maintains normal architecture, kidneys show minimal tubular necrosis, and lung inflammation features are reduced compared to WT mice. Our results confirm that zymophagy functions as a protective pathophysiological mechanism against pancreatic and extrapancreatic tissue injury in SAP. Further studies on the mechanism of VMP1-mediated selective autophagy in AP are necessary to determine its relevance and possible modulation to prevent the severity of AP.	kidney; liver; lung; necrosis; pancreas; selective autophagy; transgenic mice

Oxidative Stress, Gut Microbiota, and Extracellular Vesicles: Interconnected Pathways and Therapeutic Potentials.	Oxidative stress (OS) and gut microbiota are crucial factors influencing human health, each playing a significant role in the development and progression of chronic diseases. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the complex interplay between these two factors, focusing on how an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants leads to OS, disrupting cellular homeostasis and contributing to a range of conditions, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, and cancer. The gut microbiota, a diverse community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, is essential for regulating immune responses, metabolic pathways, and overall health. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiota composition, is closely associated with chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and various diseases. This review highlights how the gut microbiota influences and is influenced by OS, complicating the pathophysiology of many conditions. Furthermore, emerging evidence has identified extracellular vesicles (EVs) as critical facilitators of cellular crosstalk between the OS and gut microbiota. EVs also play a crucial role in signaling between the gut microbiota and host tissues, modulating immune responses, inflammation, and metabolic processes. The signaling function of EVs holds promise for the development of targeted therapies aimed at restoring microbial balance and mitigating OS. Personalized therapeutic approaches, including probiotics, antioxidants, and fecal microbiota transplantation-based strategies, can be used to address OS-related diseases and improve health outcomes. Nonetheless, further research is needed to study the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions and the potential of innovative interventions to offer novel strategies for managing OS-related diseases and enhancing overall human health.	dysbiosis; extracellular vesicle; gut microbiota; oxidative DNA damage; oxidative stress

MITOCHONDRIAL METABOLISM AND HYPOXIC SIGNALLING IN DIFFERENTIATED HUMAN CARDIOMYOCYTE AC16 CELL LINE.	Cardiovascular diseases are associated with an altered cardiomyocyte metabolism. Due to a shortage of human heart tissue, experimental studies mostly rely on alternative approaches including animal and cell culture models. Since the use of isolated primary cardiomyocytes is limited, immortalized cardiomyocyte cell lines may represent a useful tool as they closely mimic human cardiomyocytes. This study is focused on the AC16 cell line generated from adult human ventricular cardiomyocytes. Despite an increasing number of articles employing AC16 cells, the comprehensive proteomic, bioenergetic and oxygen-sensing characterization of proliferating versus differentiated cells is still lacking. Here, we provide a comparison of these two stages, particularly emphasizing cell metabolism, mitochondrial function, and hypoxic signalling. The label-free quantitative mass spectrometry revealed a decrease in autophagy and cytoplasmic translation in differentiated AC16, confirming their phenotype. Cell differentiation led to the global increase in mitochondrial proteins (e.g. OXPHOS proteins, TFAM, VWA8, etc.) reflected by elevated mitochondrial respiration. Fatty acid oxidation proteins were increased in differentiated cells, while the expression levels of proteins associated with fatty acid synthesis were unchanged, and glycolytic proteins were decreased. There was a profound difference between proliferating and differentiated cells in their response to hypoxia and anoxia/reoxygenation. We conclude that AC16 differentiation leads to proteomic and metabolic shifts and altered cell response to oxygen deprivation. This underscores the requirement for proper selection of particular differentiation state during experimental planning.	AC16; differentiation; hypoxia; metabolism; mitochondria

Pathological Changes in Extracellular Matrix Composition Orchestrate the Fibrotic Feedback Loop Through Macrophage Activation in Dupuytren's Contracture.	Dupuytren's contracture belongs to a group of fibrotic diseases that have similar mechanisms but lack effective treatment and prevention options. The excessive accumulation of connective tissue in Dupuytren's disease leads to palmar fibrosis that results in contracture deformities. The present study aimed to investigate how the tissue microenvironment in Dupuytren's contracture affects the phenotypic differentiation of macrophages, which leads to an inflammatory response and the development of chronicity in fibrotic disease. We utilized a decellularization-based method combined with proteomic analysis to identify shifts in extracellular matrix composition and the surrounding tissue microenvironment. We found that the expression of several matricellular proteins, such as MFAP4, EFEMP1 (fibulin-3), and ANGPTL2, was elevated in Dupuytren's tissue. We show that, in response to the changes in the extracellular matrix of Dupuytren's contracture, macrophages regulate the fibrotic process by cytokine production, promote myofibroblast differentiation, and increase the fibroblast migration rate. Moreover, we found that the extracellular matrix of Dupuytren's contracture directly supports the macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition, which could be another contributor to Dupuytren's disease pathogenesis. Our results suggest that interactions between macrophages and the extracellular matrix should be considered as targets for novel fibrotic disease treatment and prevention strategies in the future.

Kinetically arrested SERS-Active aggregates for biosensing.	There is a demand for biosensors capable of long-term, non-invasive monitoring of low analyte concentrations in various biofluids for diagnostics, personalized healthcare, and disease monitoring. Biofluids present challenges to biosensor sensing and stability on account of their complex composition and dynamic nature. Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) offers ultra-high sensitivity, non-destructive, real-time monitoring and non-invasive detection, ideal for sensing in complex media. Plasmonic gold nanoparticle (AuNP) SERS-active assemblies have been widely explored owning to their biocompatibility and tuneable sensitivity based on AuNP morphology. Controlled aggregation of AuNPs has been achieved by incorporating a 'molecular-glue', cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), to produce AuNP:CB[7] aggregates containing robust nanogaps (ca. 1 nm) and displaying strong, reproducible SERS signals at low concentrations, but eventually leads to irreversible precipitation. Here we employ thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-SH) to produce kinetically trapped metastable AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates. The aggregates maintain SERS-activity, are highly tuneable through facile modification of the PEG chain length and grafting density, and possess improved stability. Moreover, the AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates demonstrate low concentration detection of a common Raman reporter alongside a bioanalyte in a range of biofluids highlighting the potential application of these aggregates for non-invasive in vivo long-term monitoring alongside future customized SERS biosensing applications.

Disparity Between Functional and Structural Recovery of Placental Mitochondria After Exposure to Hypoxia.	"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) affects 5-10% of pregnancies with placental hypoxia, playing a key role as a common pathophysiological pathway of different etiologies. Despite the high metabolic rate of the placenta and its ""gatekeeper"" role in protecting the fetus from hypoxia, the response of placental mitochondria to hypoxic stress is not well understood. This study tested the hypothesis that transient exposure to hypoxia leads to a loss of placental mitochondria and affects their function. Human villous trophoblastic (JEG-3) cells were cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions for 24 h. Mitochondrial content was determined by flow cytometry before and after hypoxic exposure and after 24 h of normoxic recovery. Parameters of oxidative phosphorylation were assessed using a respirometric analyzer before hypoxic exposure and after normoxic recovery. Mitochondrial content decreased significantly from 88.5% to 26.7% during hypoxic incubation. Although it had increased to 84.2% after 24 h of normoxic recovery, oxidative phosphorylation parameters were still significantly suppressed to 1/2 to 1/3 of the pre-incubation levels. The results underscore the ability of placental cells to adapt mitochondrial content to O"	FGR; IUGR; JEG-3 cells; flow cytometry; hypoxia; mitochondrial content; mitochondrial function

Proteasome Inhibitors: Potential in Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy?	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to the destruction of peripheral joint cartilage and bone tissue. Despite the advent of biological therapies in the past decades, the complete remission of RA patients is still out of reach. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutic approaches is still open in the field of RA. Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) were originally designed to be used in hematological malignancies like multiple myeloma. However, evidence has shown that they are potent inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway, which plays a pivotal role in inflammatory processes and RA. Furthermore, inhibition of cell activation and induction of apoptosis was also reported about PIs. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge about the potential effects of PIs in RA based on reports from animal and human studies. We believe that there is substantial potential in the use of PIs in RA therapy either alone or in combination with the medications already used.	proteasome inhibitors; rheumatoid arthritis therapy

Monitoring temporal trends in cancer survival; choosing appropriate standards when accounting for age and other-cause mortality variation over time.	Along with incidence and mortality, temporal trends of cancer survival are a crucial part of cancer surveillance and control. The most common reported statistic is net survival, usually age standardized to an external reference population. However, net survival has an awkward interpretation, which has led to confusion and misunderstanding. We describe the use of reference adjusted all-cause survival and the crude probability of death as an alternative to net survival for the analysis of temporal trends in cancer survival. Reference adjusted measures aim to enable fair comparisons by incorporating additional reference expected mortality rates into the estimation process. The different approaches are illustrated using data on 95,285 women diagnosed with breast cancer in Norway 1986-2021. We compare different age distributions for age standardization and describe how using a recent calendar period for both the reference expected mortality rates and age distribution for standardization leads to simple interpretation. Reference adjusted measures for monitoring temporal trends in cancer survival can lead to improved understanding and is of more relevance to patients and policy makers who live and make decisions in the real-world. Using the most recent calendar period for both the age standard and the reference expected mortality rates leads to simple and useful interpretation of the measures. Increasing the use of reference adjusted measures in the analysis of population-based cancer studies will enhance understanding of cancer survival trends. The freely available software increases the likelihood of uptake.

The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase PRAJA1: A Key Regulator of Synaptic Dynamics and Memory Processes with Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.	The precise regulation of synaptic function by targeted protein degradation is fundamental to learning and memory, yet the roles of many brain-enriched E3 ubiquitin ligases in this process remain elusive. Here, we uncover a critical and previously unappreciated role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRAJA1 in orchestrating synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory. Utilizing C57BL/6 and 5xFAD male mice and employing a multi-faceted approach including protein biochemistry, molecular biology, in vitro electrophysiology, and behavioral assays, we demonstrate that long-term potentiation (LTP) induction triggers a rapid, proteasome-dependent downregulation of PRAJA1 within the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Critically, selective knockdown of PRAJA1 in vivo profoundly enhanced both object recognition and spatial memory, while disrupting normal exploratory behavior. Mechanistically, we reveal that PRAJA1 acts as a key regulator of synaptic architecture and transmission: its downregulation leads to a reduction in key synaptic proteins and spine density, influencing the excitatory/inhibitory balance and facilitating synaptic plasticity. Conversely, increased PRAJA1 expression potentiates GABAergic transmission. Furthermore, we identify spinophilin as a novel substrate of PRAJA1, suggesting a direct molecular link between PRAJA1 and synaptic remodeling. Strikingly, our findings implicate dysregulation of PRAJA1 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, positioning PRAJA1 as a potential therapeutic target for cognitive enhancement in neurodegenerative conditions. These results unveil PRAJA1 as a critical molecular brake on synaptic plasticity and memory formation, offering a promising new avenue for understanding and potentially treating memory impairment.

Myotube Formation and Cellular Fusion Are Diminished Due to Low Birth Weight in Piglets.	"Low birth weight (LBW) in various species leads to a pronounced skeletal muscle phenotype and can serve as a model to study muscle formation and draw conclusions for normal and pathological development. We aimed to elucidate in detail how the differentiation of muscular stem cells and their progeny are disturbed in piglets born with LBW. We isolated primary muscle cells from LBW piglets and their normal siblings with two different approaches: (1) single cells from two functionally divergent subpopulations (previously named ""fast"" and ""slow"") and (2) cells derived from isolated, intact myofibers. Subsequently, we analyzed their proliferative and differentiative capacity by determining proliferation rate, migration behavior, myotube formation, and myogenic gene and protein expression. LBW led to a decreased proliferation rate and migration potential in cells from the subpopulation fast group. Cells from LBW piglets were generally able to differentiate, but they formed smaller myotubes with less incorporated nuclei, leading to a diminished fusion rate. Myogenic gene expression was also significantly altered due to pig birth weight. Overall, early postnatal muscle development in LBW was disturbed at several crucial steps involving the establishment of a reserve stem cell pool, movement of cells towards existing myofibers, and the ability to form nascent myofibers."	low birth weight; myofiber fusion; myogenic differentiation

"""How Do You Live the Best Life You Can With This Pain?"" A Qualitative Study of Adults Living With CF and Pain in the Modulator ERA."	Despite pain's high prevalence and impact on quality of life and health outcomes, no studies have examined psychosocial approaches for treating pain in CF. We interviewed adults with CF and pain about their experiences to inform development of a CF-specific psychosocial pain management intervention. We partnered with CF Community Voice to recruit 14 adults with CF and pain for 1.5 h individual qualitative interviews and conducted a hybrid inductive-deductive thematic analysis (NVivo 14). Participants' age ranged from 23 to 64 years; Seven were taking a modulator, 4 eligible/not taking, 3 ineligible. Pain sources included lung/chest, head/sinus, joint, bone, back, neuropathic, GI; 100% reported multiple sources. Pain experience: A major theme was the close interrelationship of pain and CF. Subthemes included pain being part of life with CF, having CF leads to high pain tolerance and effects of aging with CF. Participants described CFTR modulators effect pain experiences with 3 noting improvement and 4 worsening pain. Pain centralization was common: fatigue, difficulties with cognition/sleep, increased sensitivity to nonpainful stimuli. Pain impact: Pain has a widespread negative impact on quality of life and especially mental health. Resiliency was a theme: the need for coping strategies, support and strong self-advocacy. Advice for CF Care Teams: Participants endorsed a need for increased acknowledgment of pain experiences and co-development of a treatment plan. Pain remains a prominent, burdensome symptom in the modulator era, necessitating a multi-component management approach. Results informed the development and pilot of a mind-body pain intervention for adults with CF.	central sensitization; chronic pain; cystic fibrosis; qualitative; quality of life

Synthesis of Photosensitive Bottlebrush Block Copolymers for Tunable Photonic Pigments via Light-Driven Engineering of Chain Conformation.	Structurally colored bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) offer a safer and more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional toxic pigments. For practical applications, precise control of their photonic bandgap is essential to generate various colors. A novel amphiphilic BBCPs designed with photosensitive o-nitrobenzyl ester (NE) groups strategically positioned near the main chain of the hydrophilic block is presented. Under UV radiation, these NE groups convert to acid groups, enhancing the hydrophilicity of the hydrophilic block. This leads to increased hydration and chain extension when assembled at the water-in-oil (W/O) interface of a water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsion system. The light-driven engineering of BBCP conformation enables significant control over interfacial curvature, resulting in varied internal droplet diameters and domain spacing in the final photonic pigment particles after solvent removal. Despite the inherent rigidity of BBCPs, approach achieves photonic bandgap tuning across the entire visible spectrum using only three different BBCPs. These structural colored pigments show promise for applications in sensing systems, cosmetics, and inks.	bottlebrush block copolymers; photonic pigment; structural color; sustainable materials

Systematic review of feeding difficulties in children with eosinophilic esophagitis: An EAACI Task Force report.	"The term ""feeding difficulties"" (FD) encompasses a range of phenotypes characterized by inadequate food intake and/or inappropriate eating habits for a given age. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated condition often affecting children. It leads to esophageal dysmotility, potentially impacting feeding/eating. However, little is known regarding the true prevalence of feeding/eating difficulties in children with EoE. The main objective of this systematic review was to address this knowledge gap and determine the impact of FD in children with EoE. We searched eight international databases for all published studies from inception until March 2024. All publications were screened against pre-defined eligibility criteria and critically appraised by established instruments. The substantial heterogeneity of included studies precluded meta-analyses, so a narrative synthesis of quantitative data was performed. A total of 3442 abstracts were assessed, 29 underwent full-text screening. Ten studies met eligibility criteria and were analyzed. Across these, 18 different terms to define FD and 6 diagnostic tools were used. All included papers reported quantitative data on the FD prevalence in children with EoE, ranging from 13% to 75.3%. Concomitant IgE food sensitization/allergy was common (26.2%-88%) but its impact on FD occurrence was unclear. The current literature suggests that FD is prevalent among children with EoE, particularly those with associated IgE-mediated food allergies. However, the heterogeneity of terminologies and diagnostic tools makes drawing conclusions challenging, as it might have impacted outcomes. Further research and guidance on the diagnosis and management of FD in children with EoE are needed to appropriately identify and manage such patients."	eating difficulties; eosinophilic esophagitis; feeding difficulties; prevalence; systematic review

Effect of Low Red-to-Far-Red Light on Stem Elongation and Pith Cell Development in Dicots.	In dense canopies, light becomes a limiting factor for plant growth. Many plants respond to neighbor cues by growing taller to improve light capture, a phenomenon known as the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). The major neighbor detection is via enrichment of far-red (FR) light that leads to a low red:far-red light ratio (R:FR), suppressing phytochrome activity. In tomato, low R:FR induces elongation of the internodes, but study into the role of different cell types in this response has remained limited. We characterized changes in cellular anatomy of the tomato internode in response to low R:FR and its accompanying changes in gene expression. We observed changes to the pith traits, including increases in pith layer number, pith cell diameter, and longitudinal cell length. We profiled the transcriptome in the entire internodes and in the hand-dissected pith in the central cylinder of the internode in response to low R:FR treatment and identified transcription factors (TFs) of interest that were upregulated in the central cylinder, mostly GATA, TCP, and bZIPs. We then characterized FR responses in eight dicotyledonous species. Significant pith elongation was observed in species that exhibited a strong internode elongation response. The FR-responsive expression of homologs of target GATA, TCP, and bZIP TFs in the central cylinder was conserved within the Solanaceae family. Overall, we discovered central cylinder gene expression patterns in SAS that are distinct from those of the entire internode, suggesting that some responses are unique and likely specific to vascular cell types such as pith. These patterns were conserved with close relatives of tomato but not in other dicot families we sampled, indicating that different molecular mechanisms drive FR responses in different dicots.	central cylinder; elongation; pith; shade avoidance syndrome; stem; transcription factors

Understanding Rater Cognition in Performance Assessment: A Mixed IRTree Approach.	When rater-mediated assessments are conducted, human raters often appraise the performance of ratees. However, challenges arise regarding the validity of raters' judgments in reflecting ratees' competencies according to scoring rubrics. Research on rater cognition suggests that both impersonal judgments and personal preferences can influence raters' judgmental processes. This study introduces a mixed IRTree-based model for rater judgments (MIM-R), which identifies professional and novice raters by sequentially applying the ideal-point and dominance item response theory (IRT) models to the cognitive process of raters. The simulation results demonstrate a satisfactory recovery of MIM-R parameters and highlight the importance of considering the mixed nature of raters in the rating process, as neglecting this leads to more biased estimations with an increasing proportion of novice raters. An empirical example of a creativity assessment is presented to illustrate the application and implications of MIM-R.	IRTree; item response theory; rater cognition; rater-mediated assessments

Local genetic covariance analysis with lipid traits identifies novel loci for early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.	The genetic component of early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD), accounting for ~10% of all Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, is largely unexplained. Recent studies suggest that EOAD may be enriched for variants acting in the lipid pathway. The current study examines the shared genetic heritability between EOAD and the lipid pathway using genome-wide multi-trait genetic covariance analyses. Summary statistics were obtained from the GWAS meta-analyses of EOAD by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (n=19,668) and five blood lipid traits by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (n=1,320,016). The significant results were compared between the EOAD and lipids GWAS and genetic covariance analyses were performed via SUPERGNOVA. Genes in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with top EOAD hits in identified regions of covariance with lipid traits were scored and ranked for causality by combining evidence from gene-based analysis, AD-risk scores incorporating transcriptomic and proteomic evidence, eQTL data, eQTL colocalization analyses, DNA methylation data, and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Direct comparison of GWAS results showed 5 loci overlapping between EOAD and at least one lipid trait harboring APOE, TREM2, MS4A4E, LILRA5, and LRRC25. Local genetic covariance analyses identified 3 regions of covariance between EOAD and at least one lipid trait. Gene prioritization nominated 3 likely causative genes at these loci: ANKDD1B, CUZD1, and MS4A64.The current study identified genetic covariance between EOAD and lipids, providing further evidence of shared genetic architecture and mechanistic pathways between the two traits.

NPS are among the most troubling aspects of living with dementia and their treatments have limited efficacy. We aim to investigate genetic variants contributing to NPS to identify new therapeutic targets. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for nine NPS domains measured by the NPI-Q in 12,800 participants of European ancestry with MCI or ADRD recruited by Alzheimer's disease research centers across the U.S. We found genome-wide significant signals for agitation, anxiety, apathy, delusions, and hallucinations in the These findings suggest the

Neuropathology-based approach reveals novel Alzheimer's Disease genes and highlights female-specific pathways and causal links to disrupted lipid metabolism: insights into a vicious cycle.	Dementia refers to an umbrella phenotype of many different underlying pathologies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common type. Neuropathological examination remains the gold standard for accurate AD diagnosis, however, most that we know about AD genetics is based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of clinically defined AD. Such studies have identified multiple AD susceptibility variants with a significant portion of the heritability unexplained and highlighting the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of the clinically defined entity. Furthermore, despite women's increased susceptibility to dementia, there is a lack of sex-specific genetic studies and understanding of sex-specific background for the disorder. Here, we aim to tackle the heterogeneity of AD by specifically concentrating on neuropathological features and pursuing sex-specific analysis. We bring together 14 different genomic and neuropathology datasets (6960 individuals) and we integrate our GWAS findings with transcriptomic and phenotypic data aiming to also identify biomarkers for AD progression. We uncover novel genetic associations to AD neuropathology, including BIN1 and OPCML. Our sex-specific analysis points to a role for BIN1 specifically in women as well as novel AD loci including QRFPR and SGCZ. Post-GWAS analyses illuminate the functional and biological mechanisms underlying AD and reveal sex-specific differences. Finally, through PheWAS and Mendelian Randomization analysis, we identify causal links with AD neuropathology pointing to disrupted lipid metabolism, as well as impaired peripheral immune response and liver dysfunction as part of a vicious cycle that fuels neurodegeneration.

Association of APOE alleles and polygenic profiles comprising APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 variants with Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging markers.	TOMM40 and APOC1 variants can modulate the APOE-ε4-related Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk by up to fourfold. We aim to investigate whether the genetic modulation of ε4-related AD risk is reflected in brain morphology. We tested whether 27 magnetic resonance imaging-derived neuroimaging markers of neurodegeneration (volume and thickness in temporo-limbic regions) are associated with APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 polygenic profiles using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set linked to the AD Genetic Consortium data. All brain regions studied using structural phenotypes were smaller in individuals with AD. The ε4 allele was associated with smaller limbic (entorhinal, hippocampus, parahippocampus) brain volume and cortical thickness in AD cases than controls. There were significant differences in the associations for the higher-risk and lower-risk ε4-bearing APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 profiles with temporo-limbic region markers. The APOE-AD heterogeneity may be partly attributed to the modulating role of the TOMM40 and APOC1 genes in the APOE cluster. The ε4 allele is associated with smaller values of neuroimaging markers in AD cases. Larger values of neuroimaging markers may protect against AD in the ε4 carriers. TOMM40 and APOC1 variants differentiate AD risk in the ε4 carriers. The same variants can differentiate the links between ε4 and neuroimaging markers.

X-chromosome-wide association study for Alzheimer's disease.	Due to methodological reasons, the X-chromosome has not been featured in the major genome-wide association studies on Alzheimer's Disease (AD). To address this and better characterize the genetic landscape of AD, we performed an in-depth X-Chromosome-Wide Association Study (XWAS) in 115,841 AD cases or AD proxy cases, including 52,214 clinically-diagnosed AD cases, and 613,671 controls. We considered three approaches to account for the different X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) states in females, i.e. random XCI, skewed XCI, and escape XCI. We did not detect any genome-wide significant signals (P ≤ 5 × 10

Amyloid-β predominant Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change.	Different subsets of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), including the intriguing set of individuals with severe/widespread amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques but no/mild tau tangles [Aβ-predominant (AP)-ADNC], may have distinct genetic and clinical features. Analysing National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data, we stratified 1187 participants into AP-ADNC (n = 95), low Braak primary age-related tauopathy (PART; n = 185), typical-ADNC (n = 832) and high-Braak PART (n = 75). AP-ADNC differed in some clinical features and genetic polymorphisms in the APOE, SNX1, WNT3/MAPT and IGH genes. We conclude that AP-ADNC differs from classical ADNC with implications for in vivo studies.	ADGC; NACC; amyloid-β; biomarker; diffuse plaques

Egr1 Expression Is Correlated With Synaptic Activity but Not Intrinsic Membrane Properties in Mouse Adult-Born Dentate Granule Cells.	The discovery of adult-born granule cells (aDGCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus has raised questions regarding how they develop, incorporate into the hippocampal circuitry, and contribute to learning and memory. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate the intrinsic and synaptic excitability of mouse aDGCs as they matured, enabled by using a tamoxifen-induced genetic label to birth date the aDGCs at different animal ages. Importantly, we also undertook immunofluorescence studies of the expression of the immediate early gene Egr1 and compared these findings with the electrophysiology data in the same animals. We examined two groups of animals, with aDGC birthdating when the mice were 2 months and at 7-9 months of age. In both groups, cells 4 weeks old had lower thresholds for current-evoked action potentials than older cells but fired fewer spikes during long current pulses and responded more poorly to synaptic activation. aDGCs born in both 2 and 7-9-month-old mice matured in their intrinsic excitability and synaptic properties from 4-12 weeks postgenesis, but this occurred more slowly for the older age animals. Interestingly, this pattern of intrinsic excitability changes did not correlate with the pattern of Egr1 expression. Instead, the development of Egr1 expression was correlated with the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. These results suggest that in order for aDGCs to fully participate in hippocampal circuitry, as indicated by Egr1 expression, they must have developed enough synaptic input, in spite of the greater input resistance and reduced firing threshold that characterizes young aDGCs.	adult neurogenesis; age‐dependence; dentate gyrus; immediate early genes; synaptic transmission

Role of the X Chromosome in Alzheimer Disease Genetics.	The X chromosome has remained enigmatic in Alzheimer disease (AD), yet it makes up 5% of the genome and carries a high proportion of genes expressed in the brain, making it particularly appealing as a potential source of unexplored genetic variation in AD. To perform the first large-scale X chromosome-wide association study (XWAS) of AD. This was a meta-analysis of genetic association studies in case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts from the US Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, the UK Biobank, the Finnish health registry, and the US Million Veterans Program. Risk of AD was evaluated through case-control logistic regression analyses. Data were analyzed between January 2023 and March 2024. Genetic data available from high-density single-nucleotide variant microarrays and whole-genome sequencing and summary statistics for multitissue expression and protein quantitative trait loci available from published studies were included, enabling follow-up genetic colocalization analyses. A total of 1 629 863 eligible participants were selected from referred and volunteer samples, 477 596 of whom were excluded for analysis exclusion criteria. The number of participants who declined to participate in original studies was not available. Risk of AD, reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Associations were considered at X chromosome-wide (P < 1 × 10-5) and genome-wide (P < 5 × 10-8) significance. Primary analyses are nonstratified, while secondary analyses evaluate sex-stratified effects. Analyses included 1 152 284 participants of non-Hispanic White, European ancestry (664 403 [57.7%] female and 487 881 [42.3%] male), including 138 558 individuals with AD. Six independent genetic loci passed X chromosome-wide significance, with 4 showing support for links between the genetic signal for AD and expression of nearby genes in brain and nonbrain tissues. One of these 4 loci passed conservative genome-wide significance, with its lead variant centered on an intron of SLC9A7 (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04) and colocalization analyses prioritizing both the SLC9A7 and nearby CHST7 genes. Of these 6 loci, 4 displayed evidence for escape from X chromosome inactivation with regard to AD risk. This large-scale XWAS of AD identified the novel SLC9A7 locus. SLC9A7 regulates pH homeostasis in Golgi secretory compartments and is anticipated to have downstream effects on amyloid β accumulation. Overall, this study advances our knowledge of AD genetics and may provide novel biological drug targets. The results further provide initial insights into elucidating the role of the X chromosome in sex-based differences in AD.

Phenotypic misclassification in genetic association analyses can impact the accuracy of PRS-based prediction models. The bias reduction method proposed by Tong et al. (2019) has demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the effects of bias on the estimation of association parameters between genotype and phenotype while minimizing variance by employing chart reviews on a subset of the data for validating phenotypes, however its improvement of subsequent PRS prediction accuracy remains unclear. Our study aims to fill this gap by assessing the performance of simulated PRS models and estimating the optimal number of chart reviews needed for validation. To comprehensively assess the efficacy of the bias reduction method proposed by Tong et al. in enhancing the accuracy of PRS-based prediction models, we simulated each phenotype under different correlation structures (an independent model, a weakly correlated model, a strongly correlated model) and introduced error-prone phenotypes using two distinct error mechanisms (differential and non-differential phenotyping errors). To facilitate this, we used genotype and phenotype data from 12 case-control datasets in the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) to produce simulated phenotypes. The evaluation included analyses across various misclassification rates of original phenotypes as well as quantities of validation set. Additionally, we determined the median threshold, identifying the minimal validation size required for a meaningful improvement in the accuracy of PRS-based predictions across a broad spectrum. This simulation study demonstrated that incorporating chart review does not universally guarantee enhanced performance of PRS-based prediction models. Specifically, in scenarios with minimal misclassification rates and limited validation sizes, PRS models utilizing debiased regression coefficients demonstrated inferior predictive capabilities compared to models using error-prone phenotypes. Put differently, the effectiveness of the bias reduction method is contingent upon the misclassification rates of phenotypes and the size of the validation set employed during chart reviews. Notably, when dealing with datasets featuring higher misclassification rates, the advantages of utilizing this bias reduction method become more evident, requiring a smaller validation set to achieve better performance. This study highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate validation set size to balance between the efforts of chart review and the gain in PRS prediction accuracy. Consequently, our study establishes a valuable guidance for validation planning, across a diverse array of sensitivity and specificity combinations.

Deep graph clustering, which aims to reveal the underlying graph structure and divide the nodes into different clusters without human annotations, is a fundamental yet challenging task. However, we observe that the existing methods suffer from the representation collapse problem and tend to encode samples with different classes into the same latent embedding. Consequently, the discriminative capability of nodes is limited, resulting in suboptimal clustering performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep graph clustering algorithm termed improved dual correlation reduction network (IDCRN) through improving the discriminative capability of samples. Specifically, by approximating the cross-view feature correlation matrix to an identity matrix, we reduce the redundancy between different dimensions of features, thus improving the discriminative capability of the latent space explicitly. Meanwhile, the cross-view sample correlation matrix is forced to approximate the designed clustering-refined adjacency matrix to guide the learned latent representation to recover the affinity matrix even across views, thus enhancing the discriminative capability of features implicitly. Moreover, we avoid the collapsed representation caused by the oversmoothing issue in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) through an introduced propagation regularization term, enabling IDCRN to capture the long-range information with the shallow network structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of IDCRN compared with the existing state-of-the-art deep graph clustering algorithms. The code of IDCRN is released at IDCRN. Besides, we share a collection of deep graph clustering, including papers, codes, and datasets at ADGC.

Extended genome-wide association study employing the African genome resources panel identifies novel susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease in individuals of African ancestry.	Despite a two-fold risk, individuals of African ancestry have been underrepresented in Alzheimer's disease (AD) genomics efforts. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 2,903 AD cases and 6,265 controls of African ancestry. Within-dataset results were meta-analyzed, followed by functional genomics analyses. A novel AD-risk locus was identified in MPDZ on chromosome (chr) 9p23 (rs141610415, MAF = 0.002, p = 3.68×10 These analyses identified novel AD-associated loci in individuals of African ancestry and suggest that degree of African ancestry modulates some associations. Increased sample sets covering as much African genetic diversity as possible will be critical to identify additional loci and deconvolute local genetic ancestry effects. Genetic ancestry significantly impacts risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Although individuals of African ancestry are twice as likely to develop AD, they are vastly underrepresented in AD genomics studies. The Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium has previously identified 16 common and rare genetic loci associated with AD in African American individuals. The current analyses significantly expand this effort by increasing the sample size and extending ancestral diversity by including populations from continental Africa. Single variant meta-analysis identified a novel genome-wide significant AD-risk locus in individuals of African ancestry at the MPDZ gene, and 11 additional novel loci with suggestive genome-wide significance at p < 9×10-7. Comparison of African American datasets with samples of higher degree of African ancestry demonstrated differing patterns of association and linkage disequilibrium at one of these loci, suggesting that degree and/or geographic origin of African ancestry modulates the effect at this locus. These findings illustrate the importance of increasing number and ancestral diversity of African ancestry samples in AD genomics studies to fully disentangle the genetic architecture underlying AD, and yield more effective ancestry-informed genetic screening tools and therapeutic interventions.

Quality over quantity: powering neuroimaging samples in psychiatry.	Neuroimaging has been widely adopted in psychiatric research, with hopes that these non-invasive methods will provide important clues to the underpinnings and prediction of various mental health symptoms and outcomes. However, the translational impact of neuroimaging has not yet reached its promise, despite the plethora of computational methods, tools, and datasets at our disposal. Some have lamented that too many psychiatric neuroimaging studies have been underpowered with respect to sample size. In this review, we encourage this discourse to shift from a focus on sheer increases in sample size to more thoughtful choices surrounding experimental study designs. We propose considerations at multiple decision points throughout the study design, data modeling and analysis process that may help researchers working in psychiatric neuroimaging boost power for their research questions of interest without necessarily increasing sample size. We also provide suggestions for leveraging multiple datasets to inform each other and strengthen our confidence in the generalization of findings to both population-level and clinical samples. Through a greater emphasis on improving the quality of brain-based and clinical measures rather than merely quantity, meaningful and potentially translational clinical associations with neuroimaging measures can be achieved with more modest sample sizes in psychiatry.

Novel early-onset Alzheimer-associated genes influence risk through dysregulation of glutamate, immune activation, and intracell signaling pathways.	Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a highly polygenic disease that presents with relatively earlier onset (≤70yo; EOAD) in about 5% of cases. Around 90% of these EOAD cases remain unexplained by pathogenic mutations. Using data from EOAD cases and controls, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and trans-ancestry meta-analysis on non-Hispanic Whites (NHW, NCase=6,282, NControl=13,386), African Americans (AA NCase=782, NControl=3,663) and East Asians (NCase=375, NControl=838 CO). We identified eight novel significant loci: six in the ancestry-specific analyses and two in the trans-ancestry analysis. By integrating gene-based analysis, eQTL, pQTL and functional annotations, we nominate four novel genes that are involved in microglia activation, glutamate production, and signaling pathways. These results indicate that EOAD, although sharing many genes with LOAD, harbors unique genes and pathways that could be used to create better prediction models or target identification for this type of AD.

Biobank-wide association scan identifies risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease and endophenotypes.	Rich data from large biobanks, coupled with increasingly accessible association statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), provide great opportunities to dissect the complex relationships among human traits and diseases. We introduce BADGERS, a powerful method to perform polygenic score-based biobank-wide association scans. Compared to traditional approaches, BADGERS uses GWAS summary statistics as input and does not require multiple traits to be measured in the same cohort. We applied BADGERS to two independent datasets for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD; n=61,212). Among 1738 traits in the UK biobank, we identified 48 significant associations for AD. Family history, high cholesterol, and numerous traits related to intelligence and education showed strong and independent associations with AD. Furthermore, we identified 41 significant associations for a variety of AD endophenotypes. While family history and high cholesterol were strongly associated with AD subgroups and pathologies, only intelligence and education-related traits predicted pre-clinical cognitive phenotypes. These results provide novel insights into the distinct biological processes underlying various risk factors for AD.	Alzheimer's disease; GWAS; UK-biobank; genetics; genomics; human; neuroscience

Genetic associations with psychosis and affective disturbance in Alzheimer's disease.	Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) commonly experience neuropsychiatric symptoms of psychosis (AD+P) and/or affective disturbance (depression, anxiety, and/or irritability, AD+A). This study's goal was to identify the genetic architecture of AD+P and AD+A, as well as their genetically correlated phenotypes. Genome-wide association meta-analysis of 9988 AD participants from six source studies with participants characterized for AD+P AD+A, and a joint phenotype (AD+A+P). AD+P and AD+A were genetically correlated. However, AD+P and AD+A diverged in their genetic correlations with psychiatric phenotypes in individuals without AD. AD+P was negatively genetically correlated with bipolar disorder and positively with depressive symptoms. AD+A was positively correlated with anxiety disorder and more strongly correlated than AD+P with depressive symptoms. AD+P and AD+A+P had significant estimated heritability, whereas AD+A did not. Examination of the loci most strongly associated with the three phenotypes revealed overlapping and unique associations. AD+P, AD+A, and AD+A+P have both shared and divergent genetic associations pointing to the importance of incorporating genetic insights into future treatment development. It has long been known that psychotic and affective symptoms are often comorbid in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Here we examined for the first time the genetic architecture underlying this clinical observation, determining that psychotic and affective phenotypes in Alzheimer's disease are genetically correlated.Nevertheless, psychotic and affective phenotypes in Alzheimer's disease diverged in their genetic correlations with psychiatric phenotypes assessed in individuals without Alzheimer's disease. Psychosis in Alzheimer's disease was negatively genetically correlated with bipolar disorder and positively with depressive symptoms, whereas the affective phenotypes in Alzheimer's disease were positively correlated with anxiety disorder and more strongly correlated than psychosis with depressive symptoms.Psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, and the joint psychotic and affective phenotype, had significant estimated heritability, whereas the affective in AD did not.Examination of the loci most strongly associated with the psychotic, affective, or joint phenotypes revealed overlapping and unique associations.

The Role of X Chromosome in Alzheimer's Disease Genetics.	The X chromosome has remained enigmatic in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet it makes up 5% of the genome and carries a high proportion of genes expressed in the brain, making it particularly appealing as a potential source of unexplored genetic variation in AD. Perform the first large-scale X chromosome-wide association study (XWAS) of AD. Primary analyses are non-stratified, while secondary analyses evaluate sex-stratified effects. Meta-analysis of genetic association studies in case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts from the US Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), the UK Biobank (UKB), the Finnish health registry (FinnGen), and the US Million Veterans Program (MVP). Risk for AD evaluated through case-control logistic regression analyses. Data were analyzed between January 2023 and March 2024. Genetic data available from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Summary statistics for multi-tissue expression and protein quantitative trait loci (QTL) available from published studies, enabling follow-up genetic colocalization analyses. 1,629,863 eligible participants were selected from referred and volunteer samples, of which 477,596 were excluded for analysis exclusion criteria. Number of participants who declined to participate in original studies was not available. Risk for AD (odds ratio; OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Associations were considered at X-chromosome-wide (P-value<1e-5) and genome-wide (P-value<5e-8) significance. Analyses included 1,152,284 non-Hispanic White European ancestry subjects (57.3% females), including 138,558 cases. 6 independent genetic loci passed X-chromosome-wide significance, with 4 showing support for causal links between the genetic signal for AD and expression of nearby genes in brain and non-brain tissues. One of these 4 loci passed conservative genome-wide significance, with its lead variant centered on an intron of We performed the first large-scale XWAS of AD and identified the novel

An X Chromosome Transcriptome Wide Association Study Implicates ARMCX6 in Alzheimer's Disease.	The X chromosome is often omitted in disease association studies despite containing thousands of genes that may provide insight into well-known sex differences in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To model the expression of X chromosome genes and evaluate their impact on AD risk in a sex-stratified manner. Using elastic net, we evaluated multiple modeling strategies in a set of 175 whole blood samples and 126 brain cortex samples, with whole genome sequencing and RNA-seq data. SNPs (MAF > 0.05) within the cis-regulatory window were used to train tissue-specific models of each gene. We apply the best models in both tissues to sex-stratified summary statistics from a meta-analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) studies to identify AD-related genes on the X chromosome. Across different model parameters, sample sex, and tissue types, we modeled the expression of 217 genes (95 genes in blood and 135 genes in brain cortex). The average model R2 was 0.12 (range from 0.03 to 0.34). We also compared sex-stratified and sex-combined models on the X chromosome. We further investigated genes that escaped X chromosome inactivation (XCI) to determine if their genetic regulation patterns were distinct. We found ten genes associated with AD at p < 0.05, with only ARMCX6 in female brain cortex (p = 0.008) nearing the significance threshold after adjusting for multiple testing (α = 0.002). We optimized the expression prediction of X chromosome genes, applied these models to sex-stratified AD GWAS summary statistics, and identified one putative AD risk gene, ARMCX6.

Whole genome-wide sequence analysis of long-lived families (Long-Life Family Study) identifies MTUS2 gene associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.	Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) has a strong genetic component. Participants in Long-Life Family Study (LLFS) exhibit delayed onset of dementia, offering a unique opportunity to investigate LOAD genetics. We conducted a whole genome sequence analysis of 3475 LLFS members. Genetic associations were examined in six independent studies (N = 14,260) with a wide range of LOAD risk. Association analysis in a sub-sample of the LLFS cohort (N = 1739) evaluated the association of LOAD variants with beta amyloid (Aβ) levels. We identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in tight linkage disequilibrium within the MTUS2 gene associated with LOAD (rs73154407, p = 7.6 × 10 MTUS2 encodes a microtubule associated protein implicated in the development and function of the nervous system, making it a plausible candidate to investigate LOAD biology. Long-Life Family Study (LLFS) families may harbor late onset Alzheimer's dementia (LOAD) variants. LLFS whole genome sequence analysis identified MTUS2 gene variants associated with LOAD. The observed LLFS variants generalized to cohorts with wide range of LOAD risk. The association of MTUS2 with LOAD was stronger within high levels of beta amyloid. Our results provide evidence for MTUS2 gene as a novel LOAD candidate locus.	MTUS2 gene; genetic risk; late‐onset Alzheimer's disease; microtubule protein; whole genome sequence

Longitudinal change in memory performance as a strong endophenotype for Alzheimer's disease.	Although large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted on AD, few have been conducted on continuous measures of memory performance and memory decline. We conducted a cross-ancestry GWAS on memory performance (in 27,633 participants) and memory decline (in 22,365 participants; 129,201 observations) by leveraging harmonized cognitive data from four aging cohorts. We found high heritability for two ancestry backgrounds. Further, we found a novel ancestry locus for memory decline on chromosome 4 (rs6848524) and three loci in the non-Hispanic Black ancestry group for memory performance on chromosomes 2 (rs111471504), 7 (rs4142249), and 15 (rs74381744). In our gene-level analysis, we found novel genes for memory decline on chromosomes 1 (SLC25A44), 11 (BSX), and 15 (DPP8). Memory performance and memory decline shared genetic architecture with AD-related traits, neuropsychiatric traits, and autoimmune traits. We discovered several novel loci, genes, and genetic correlations associated with late-life memory performance and decline. Late-life memory has high heritability that is similar across ancestries. We discovered four novel variants associated with late-life memory. We identified four novel genes associated with late-life memory. Late-life memory shares genetic architecture with psychiatric/autoimmune traits.	Alzheimer's disease; GWAS; genetics; memory

Sex-specific genetic architecture of late-life memory performance.	Women demonstrate a memory advantage when cognitively healthy yet lose this advantage to men in Alzheimer's disease. However, the genetic underpinnings of this sex difference in memory performance remain unclear. We conducted the largest sex-aware genetic study on late-life memory to date (N We identified three sex-specific loci (rs67099044-CBLN2, rs719070-SCHIP1/IQCJ-SCHIP), including an X-chromosome locus (rs5935633-EGL6/TCEANC/OFD1), that associated with memory. Additionally, we identified heparan sulfate signaling as a sex-specific pathway and found sex-specific genetic correlations between memory and cardiovascular, immune, and education traits. This study showed memory is highly and comparably heritable across sexes, as well as highlighted novel sex-specific genes, pathways, and genetic correlations that related to late-life memory. Demonstrated the heritable component of late-life memory is similar across sexes. Identified two genetic loci with a sex-interaction with baseline memory. Identified an X-chromosome locus associated with memory decline in females. Highlighted sex-specific candidate genes and pathways associated with memory. Revealed sex-specific shared genetic architecture between memory and complex traits.	Alzheimer's disease; GWAS; Genomics; aging; cognition; endophenotypes; memory; sex differences; sex-specific

LATE-NC risk alleles (in TMEM106B, GRN, and ABCC9 genes) among persons with African ancestry.	Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) affects approximately one-third of older individuals and is associated with cognitive impairment. However, there is a highly incomplete understanding of the genetic determinants of LATE neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) in diverse populations. The defining neuropathologic feature of LATE-NC is TDP-43 proteinopathy, often with comorbid hippocampal sclerosis (HS). In terms of genetic risk factors, LATE-NC and/or HS are associated with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 3 genes-TMEM106B (rs1990622), GRN (rs5848), and ABCC9 (rs1914361 and rs701478). We evaluated these 3 genes in convenience samples of individuals of African ancestry. The allele frequencies of the LATE-associated alleles were significantly different between persons of primarily African (versus European) ancestry: In persons of African ancestry, the risk-associated alleles for TMEM106B and ABCC9 were less frequent, whereas the risk allele in GRN was more frequent. We performed an exploratory analysis of data from African-American subjects processed by the Alzheimer's Disease Genomics Consortium, with a subset of African-American participants (n = 166) having corroborating neuropathologic data through the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). In this limited-size sample, the ABCC9/rs1914361 SNV was associated with HS pathology. More work is required concerning the genetic factors influencing non-Alzheimer disease pathology such as LATE-NC in diverse cohorts.

Sex differences are established in associations between apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, it is unclear whether sex-specific cognitive consequences of APOE are consistent across races and extend to the APOE ε2 allele. To investigate whether sex and race modify APOE ε4 and ε2 associations with cognition. This genetic association study included longitudinal cognitive data from 4 AD and cognitive aging cohorts. Participants were older than 60 years and self-identified as non-Hispanic White or non-Hispanic Black (hereafter, White and Black). Data were previously collected across multiple US locations from 1994 to 2018. Secondary analyses began December 2021 and ended September 2022. Harmonized composite scores for memory, executive function, and language were generated using psychometric approaches. Linear regression assessed interactions between APOE ε4 or APOE ε2 and sex on baseline cognitive scores, while linear mixed-effect models assessed interactions on cognitive trajectories. The intersectional effect of race was modeled using an APOE × sex × race interaction term, assessing whether APOE × sex interactions differed by race. Models were adjusted for age at baseline and corrected for multiple comparisons. Of 32 427 participants who met inclusion criteria, there were 19 007 females (59%), 4453 Black individuals (14%), and 27 974 White individuals (86%); the mean (SD) age at baseline was 74 years (7.9). At baseline, 6048 individuals (19%) had AD, 4398 (14%) were APOE ε2 carriers, and 12 538 (38%) were APOE ε4 carriers. Participants missing APOE status were excluded (n = 9266). For APOE ε4, a robust sex interaction was observed on baseline memory (β = -0.071, SE = 0.014; P = 9.6 × 10-7), whereby the APOE ε4 negative effect was stronger in females compared with males and did not significantly differ among races. Contrastingly, despite the large sample size, no APOE ε2 × sex interactions on cognition were observed among all participants. When testing for intersectional effects of sex, APOE ε2, and race, an interaction was revealed on baseline executive function among individuals who were cognitively unimpaired (β = -0.165, SE = 0.066; P = .01), whereby the APOE ε2 protective effect was female-specific among White individuals but male-specific among Black individuals. In this study, while race did not modify sex differences in APOE ε4, the APOE ε2 protective effect could vary by race and sex. Although female sex enhanced ε4-associated risk, there was no comparable sex difference in ε2, suggesting biological pathways underlying ε4-associated risk are distinct from ε2 and likely intersect with age-related changes in sex biology.

Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study to improve behavioral prediction from neuroimaging in smaller replication samples.	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a popular and useful non-invasive method to map patterns of brain structure and function to complex human traits. Recently published observations in multiple large scale studies cast doubt upon these prospects, particularly for prediction of cognitive traits from structural and resting state functional MRI, which seems to account for little behavioral variability. We leverage baseline data from thousands of children in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development

Contrastive learning has recently attracted plenty of attention in deep graph clustering due to its promising performance. However, complicated data augmentations and time-consuming graph convolutional operations undermine the efficiency of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a simple contrastive graph clustering (SCGC) algorithm to improve the existing methods from the perspectives of network architecture, data augmentation, and objective function. As to the architecture, our network includes two main parts, that is, preprocessing and network backbone. A simple low-pass denoising operation conducts neighbor information aggregation as an independent preprocessing, and only two multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are included as the backbone. For data augmentation, instead of introducing complex operations over graphs, we construct two augmented views of the same vertex by designing parameter unshared Siamese encoders and perturbing the node embeddings directly. Finally, as to the objective function, to further improve the clustering performance, a novel cross-view structural consistency objective function is designed to enhance the discriminative capability of the learned network. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets validate our proposed algorithm's effectiveness and superiority. Significantly, our algorithm outperforms the recent contrastive deep clustering competitors with at least seven times speedup on average. The code of SCGC is released at SCGC. Besides, we share a collection of deep graph clustering, including papers, codes, and datasets at ADGC.

An X Chromosome Transcriptome Wide Association Study Implicates ARMCX6 in Alzheimer's Disease.	The X chromosome is often omitted in disease association studies despite containing thousands of genes which may provide insight into well-known sex differences in the risk of Alzheimer's Disease. To model the expression of X chromosome genes and evaluate their impact on Alzheimer's Disease risk in a sex-stratified manner. Using elastic net, we evaluated multiple modeling strategies in a set of 175 whole blood samples and 126 brain cortex samples, with whole genome sequencing and RNA-seq data. SNPs (MAF>0.05) within the Across different model parameters, sample sex, and tissue types, we modeled the expression of 217 genes (95 genes in blood and 135 genes in brain cortex).

A haptoglobin (HP) structural variant alters the effect of APOE alleles on Alzheimer's disease.	Haptoglobin (HP) is an antioxidant of apolipoprotein E (APOE), and previous reports have shown HP binds with APOE and amyloid beta (Aβ) to aid its clearance. A common structural variant of the HP gene distinguishes it into two alleles: HP1 and HP2. HP genotypes were imputed in 29 cohorts from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (N = 20,512). Associations between the HP polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and age of onset through APOE interactions were investigated using regression models. The HP polymorphism significantly impacts AD risk in European-descent individuals (and in meta-analysis with African-descent individuals) by modifying both the protective effect of APOE ε2 and the detrimental effect of APOE ε4. The effect is particularly significant among APOE ε4 carriers. The effect modification of APOE by HP suggests adjustment and/or stratification by HP genotype is warranted when APOE risk is considered. Our findings also provided directions for further investigations on potential mechanisms behind this association.	Alzheimer's disease; age at onset; apolipoprotein E; haptoglobin polymorphism

Characterizing the optimal fMRI paradigms for detecting behaviorally relevant functional connectivity (FC) patterns is a critical step to furthering our knowledge of the neural basis of behavior. Previous studies suggested that FC patterns derived from task fMRI paradigms, which we refer to as task-based FC, are better correlated with individual differences in behavior than resting-state FC, but the consistency and generalizability of this advantage across task conditions was not fully explored. Using data from resting-state fMRI and three fMRI tasks from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study ® (ABCD), we tested whether the observed improvement in behavioral prediction power of task-based FC can be attributed to changes in brain activity induced by the task design. We decomposed the task fMRI time course of each task into the task model fit (the fitted time course of the task condition regressors from the single-subject general linear model) and the task model residuals, calculated their respective FC, and compared the behavioral prediction performance of these FC estimates to resting-state FC and the original task-based FC. The FC of the task model fit was better than the FC of the task model residual and resting-state FC at predicting a measure of general cognitive ability or two measures of performance on the fMRI tasks. The superior behavioral prediction performance of the FC of the task model fit was content-specific insofar as it was only observed for fMRI tasks that probed similar cognitive constructs to the predicted behavior of interest. To our surprise, the task model parameters, the beta estimates of the task condition regressors, were equally if not more predictive of behavioral differences than all FC measures. These results showed that the observed improvement of behavioral prediction afforded by task-based FC was largely driven by the FC patterns associated with the task design. Together with previous studies, our findings highlighted the importance of task design in eliciting behaviorally meaningful brain activation and FC patterns.

Identification of novel genes for age-at-onset of Alzheimer's disease by combining quantitative and survival trait analyses.	Our understanding of the genetic predisposition for age-at-onset (AAO) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is limited. Here, we sought to identify genes modifying AAO and examined whether any have sex-specific effects. Genome-wide association analysis were performed on imputed genetic data of 9219 AD cases and 10,345 controls from 20 cohorts of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium. AAO was modeled from cases directly and as a survival outcome. We identified 11 genome-wide significant loci (P < 5 × 10 Genes that influence AAO of AD are excellent therapeutic targets for delaying onset of AD. Several loci identified include genes with promising functional implications for AD.	Alzheimer's disease; age at onset; genetic association; polygenic risk score; quantitative trait; survival model

African ancestry GWAS of dementia in a large military cohort identifies significant risk loci.	While genome wide association studies (GWASs) of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in European (EUR) ancestry cohorts have identified approximately 83 potentially independent AD risk loci, progress in non-European populations has lagged. In this study, data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP), a biobank which includes genetic data from more than 650,000 US Veteran participants, was used to examine dementia genetics in an African descent (AFR) cohort. A GWAS of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), an expanded AD phenotype including dementias such as vascular and non-specific dementia that included 4012 cases and 18,435 controls age 60+ in AFR MVP participants was performed. A proxy dementia GWAS based on survey-reported parental AD or dementia (n = 4385 maternal cases, 2256 paternal cases, and 45,970 controls) was also performed. These two GWASs were meta-analyzed, and then subsequently compared and meta-analyzed with the results from a previous AFR AD GWAS from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). A meta-analysis of common variants across the MVP ADRD and proxy GWASs yielded GWAS significant associations in the region of APOE (p = 2.48 × 10

This study used admixture mapping to prioritize the genetic regions associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in African American (AA) individuals, followed by ancestry-aware regression analysis to fine-map the prioritized regions. We analyzed 10,271 individuals from 17 different AA datasets. We performed admixture mapping and meta-analyzed the results. We then used regression analysis, adjusting for local ancestry main effects and interactions with genotype, to refine the regions identified from admixture mapping. Finally, we leveraged in silico annotation and differential gene expression data to prioritize AD-related variants and genes. Admixture mapping identified two genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 17p13.2 (p = 2.2 × 10 Our ancestry-aware regression approach showed that AA individuals have a lower risk of AD if they inherited African ancestry admixture block at the 17p13.2 locus. We identified two genome-wide significant admixture mapping signals: on chromosomes 17p13.2 and 18q21.33, which are novel in African American (AA) populations. Our ancestry-aware regression approach showed that AA individuals have a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) if they inherited African ancestry admixture block at the 17p13.2 locus. We found that the overall proportion of African ancestry does not differ between the cases and controls that suggest African genetic ancestry alone is not likely to explain the AD prevalence difference between AA and non-Hispanic White populations.

"The classic pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (AD neuropathologic changes, or ADNC). However, brains from individuals clinically diagnosed with ""AD-type"" (amnestic) dementia usually harbor heterogeneous neuropathologies in addition to, or other than, ADNC. We hypothesized that some AD-type dementia associated genetic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified from large genomewide association studies (GWAS) were associated with non-ADNC neuropathologies. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from multiple studies with available genotype and neuropathologic phenotype information. Clinical AD/dementia risk alleles of interest were derived from the very large GWAS by Bellenguez et al. (2022) who reported 83 clinical AD/dementia-linked SNVs in addition to the APOE risk alleles. To query the pathologic phenotypes associated with variation of those SNVs, National Alzheimer's disease Coordinating Center (NACC) neuropathologic data were linked to AD Sequencing Project (ADSP) and AD Genomics Consortium (ADGC) data. Separate data were obtained from the harmonized Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). A total of 4811 European participants had at least ADNC neuropathology data and also genotype data available; data were meta-analyzed across cohorts. As expected, a subset of dementia-associated SNVs were associated with ADNC risk in Europeans-e.g., BIN1, PICALM, CR1, MME, and COX7C. Other gene variants linked to (clinical) AD dementia were associated with non-ADNC pathologies. For example, the associations of GRN and TMEM106B SNVs with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) were replicated. In addition, SNVs in TNIP1 and WNT3 previously reported as AD-related were instead associated with hippocampal sclerosis pathology. Some genotype/neuropathology association trends were not statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05 after correcting for multiple testing, but were intriguing. For example, variants in SORL1 and TPCN1 showed trends for association with LATE-NC whereas Lewy body pathology trended toward association with USP6NL and BIN1 gene variants. A smaller cohort of non-European subjects (n = 273, approximately one-half of whom were African-Americans) provided the basis for additional exploratory analyses. Overall, these findings were consistent with the hypothesis that some genetic variants linked to AD dementia risk exert their affect by influencing non-ADNC neuropathologies."

Common Variants Near ZIC1 and ZIC4 in Autopsy-Confirmed Multiple System Atrophy.	Multiple System Atrophy is a rare neurodegenerative disease with alpha-synuclein aggregation in glial cytoplasmic inclusions and either predominant olivopontocerebellar atrophy or striatonigral degeneration, leading to dysautonomia, parkinsonism, and cerebellar ataxia. One prior genome-wide association study in mainly clinically diagnosed patients with Multiple System Atrophy failed to identify genetic variants predisposing for the disease. Since the clinical diagnosis of Multiple System Atrophy yields a high rate of misdiagnosis when compared to the neuropathological gold standard, we studied only autopsy-confirmed cases. We studied common genetic variations in Multiple System Atrophy cases (N = 731) and controls (N = 2898). The most strongly disease-associated markers were rs16859966 on chromosome 3, rs7013955 on chromosome 8, and rs116607983 on chromosome 4 with P-values below 5 × 10 Since mutations of ZIC1 and ZIC4 and paraneoplastic autoantibodies directed against ZIC4 are associated with severe cerebellar dysfunction, we conducted immunohistochemical analyses in brain tissue of the frontal cortex and the cerebellum from 24 Multiple System Atrophy patients. Strong immunohistochemical expression of ZIC4 was detected in a subset of neurons of the dentate nucleus in all healthy controls and in patients with striatonigral degeneration, whereas ZIC4-immunoreactive neurons were significantly reduced inpatients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy. These findings point to a potential ZIC4-mediated vulnerability of neurons in Multiple System Atrophy. © 2022 The Authors.

Nine actions to successfully restore tropical agroecosystems.	Well-designed approaches to ecological restoration can benefit nature and society. This is particularly the case in tropical agroecosystems, where restoration can provide substantial socioecological benefits at relatively low costs. To successfully restore tropical agroecosystems and maximise benefits, initiatives must begin by considering 'who' should be involved in and benefit from restoration, and 'what', 'where', and 'how' restoration should occur. Based on collective experience of restoring tropical agroecosystems worldwide, we present nine actions to guide future restoration of these systems, supported by case studies that demonstrate our actions being used successfully in practice and highlighting cases where poorly designed restoration has been damaging. We call for increased restoration activity in tropical agroecosystems during the current UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.	ecological restoration; ecosystem restoration; landscape recovery; natural regeneration; stakeholder engagement; tropical agriculture

Genome-wide association and multi-omics studies identify MGMT as a novel risk gene for Alzheimer's disease among women.	Variants in the tau gene (MAPT) region are associated with breast cancer in women and Alzheimer's disease (AD) among persons lacking apolipoprotein E ε4 (ε4-). To identify novel genes associated with tau-related pathology, we conducted two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for AD, one among 10,340 ε4- women in the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and another in 31 members (22 women) of a consanguineous Hutterite kindred. We identified novel associations of AD with MGMT variants in the ADGC (rs12775171, odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, P = 4.9 × 10 These findings suggest that epigenetically regulated MGMT expression is involved in AD pathogenesis, especially in women.

Sex differences in the genetic architecture of cognitive resilience to Alzheimer's disease.	Approximately 30% of elderly adults are cognitively unimpaired at time of death despite the presence of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology at autopsy. Studying individuals who are resilient to the cognitive consequences of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology may uncover novel therapeutic targets to treat Alzheimer's disease. It is well established that there are sex differences in response to Alzheimer's disease pathology, and growing evidence suggests that genetic factors may contribute to these differences. Taken together, we sought to elucidate sex-specific genetic drivers of resilience. We extended our recent large scale genomic analysis of resilience in which we harmonized cognitive data across four cohorts of cognitive ageing, in vivo amyloid PET across two cohorts, and autopsy measures of amyloid neuritic plaque burden across two cohorts. These data were leveraged to build robust, continuous resilience phenotypes. With these phenotypes, we performed sex-stratified [n (males) = 2093, n (females) = 2931] and sex-interaction [n (both sexes) = 5024] genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses to clarify the variants, genes and molecular pathways that relate to resilience in a sex-specific manner. Estimated among cognitively normal individuals of both sexes, resilience was 20-25% heritable, and when estimated in either sex among cognitively normal individuals, resilience was 15-44% heritable. In our GWAS, we identified a female-specific locus on chromosome 10 [rs827389, β (females) = 0.08, P (females) = 5.76 × 10-09, β (males) = -0.01, P(males) = 0.70, β (interaction) = 0.09, P (interaction) = 1.01 × 10-04] in which the minor allele was associated with higher resilience scores among females. This locus is located within chromatin loops that interact with promoters of genes involved in RNA processing, including GATA3. Finally, our genetic correlation analyses revealed shared genetic architecture between resilience phenotypes and other complex traits, including a female-specific association with frontotemporal dementia and male-specific associations with heart rate variability traits. We also observed opposing associations between sexes for multiple sclerosis, such that more resilient females had a lower genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, and more resilient males had a higher genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Overall, we identified sex differences in the genetic architecture of resilience, identified a female-specific resilience locus and highlighted numerous sex-specific molecular pathways that may underly resilience to Alzheimer's disease pathology. This study illustrates the need to conduct sex-aware genomic analyses to identify novel targets that are unidentified in sex-agnostic models. Our findings support the theory that the most successful treatment for an individual with Alzheimer's disease may be personalized based on their biological sex and genetic context.

Protein phosphatase 2A and complement component 4 are linked to the protective effect of APOE ɛ2 for Alzheimer's disease.	The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ2 allele reduces risk against Alzheimer's disease (AD) but mechanisms underlying this effect are largely unknown. We conducted a genome-wide association study for AD among 2096 ɛ2 carriers. The potential role of the top-ranked gene and complement 4 (C4) proteins, which were previously linked to AD in ɛ2 carriers, was investigated using human isogenic APOE allele-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes and in 224 neuropathologically examined human brains.

ConspectusEngineering sensing interfaces with functional nanomaterials have aroused great interest in constructing novel analytical platforms. The good catalytic abilities and physicochemical properties allow functional nanomaterials to perform catalytic signal transductions and synergistically amplify biorecognition events for efficient target analysis. However, further boosting their catalytic performances poses grand challenges in achieving more sensitive and selective sample assays. Besides, nanomaterials with abundant atomic compositions and complex structural characteristics bring about more difficulties in understanding the underlying mechanism of signal amplification. Atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs), as an emerging class of heterogeneous catalysts, feature support-stabilized isolated metal catalytic sites, showing maximum metal utilization and a strong metal-support interfacial interaction. These unique structural characteristics are akin to those of homogeneous catalysts, which have well-defined coordination structures between metal sites with synthetic or biological ligands. By integrating the advantages of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts, ADMCs present superior catalytic activity and specificity relative to the nanoparticles formed by the nonuniform aggregation of active sites. ADMC-enabled sensing platforms have been demonstrated to realize advanced applications in various fields. Notably, the easily tunable coordination structures of ADMCs bring more opportunities to improve their catalytic performance, further moving toward efficient signal transduction ability. Besides, by leveraging their inherent physicochemical properties and various detection strategies, ADMC-enabled sensing interfaces not only achieve enhanced signal transductions but also show diversified output models. Such superior functions allow ADMC-enabled sensing platforms to access the goal of high-performance detection of trace targets and making significant progress in analytical chemistry.In this Account, we provide an overview of recent progress in atomically dispersed metal-involved interfaces in analytical chemistry. The engineering strategies focused on regulating metal centers, integrating multisite synergy, and tuning charge transport pathways are discussed to boost the catalytic activity and specificity of ADMCs as well as expand their multifunctionality. Combined with various transduction models, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, chemiluminescence, electrochemiluminescence, and photoelectrochemistry, ADMC-based sensors achieve efficient detection of diverse analytes. Specifically, the underlying mechanisms of signal transduction are highlighted. Finally, the perspective and challenges of the ADMC-enabled interface for analytical chemistry are further proposed. We hope that this Account will afford significant inspiration toward the design of ADMCs and the decoding of the improved sensing interfaces.

Mounting evidence implicates inflammation as a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. We previously identified pro-inflammatory soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) metabolites to be elevated in plasma and CSF of AD patients and to be associated with lower cognition in non-AD subjects. Soluble epoxide hydrolase is a key enzyme converting anti-inflammatory epoxy fatty acids to pro-inflammatory diols, reported to be elevated in multiple cardiometabolic disorders. Here we analyzed over 700 fasting plasma samples from the baseline of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2/GO study. We applied targeted mass spectrometry method to provide absolute quantifications of over 150 metabolites from oxylipin and endocannabinoids pathway, interrogating the role for inflammation/immune dysregulation and the key enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase in AD. We provide further insights into the regulation of this pathway in different disease stages, APOE genotypes and between sexes. Additionally, we investigated in mild cognitive impaired (MCI) patients, metabolic signatures that inform about resilience to progression and conversion to AD. Key findings include I) confirmed disruption in this key central pathway of inflammation and pointed to dysregulation of sEH in AD with sex and disease stage differences; II) identified markers of disease progression and cognitive resilience using sex and ApoE genotype stratified analysis highlighting an important role for bile acids, lipid peroxidation and stress response hormone cortisol. In conclusion, we provide molecular insights into a central pathway of inflammation and links to cognitive dysfunction, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches that are based on targeting inflammation tailored for subgroups of individuals based on their sex, APOE genotype and their metabolic profile.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and progression are significantly influenced by APOE genotype with APOE4 increasing and APOE2 decreasing susceptibility compared to APOE3. While the effect of those genotypes was extensively studied on blood metabolome, less is known about their impact in the brain. Here we investigated the impacts of APOE genotypes and aging on brain metabolic profiles across the lifespan, using human APOE-targeted replacement mice. Biocrates P180 targeted metabolomics platform was used to measure a broad range of metabolites probing various metabolic processes. In all genotypes investigated we report changes in acylcarnitines, biogenic amines, amino acids, phospholipids and sphingomyelins during aging. The decreased ratio of medium to long-chain acylcarnitine suggests a reduced level of fatty acid β-oxidation and thus the possibility of mitochondrial dysfunction as these animals age. Additionally, aging APOE2/2 mice had altered branch-chain amino acids (BCAA) profile and increased their downstream metabolite C5 acylcarnitine, indicating increased branched-chain amino acid utilization in TCA cycle and better energetic profile endowed by this protective genotype. We compared these results with human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex metabolomic data from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project, and we found that the carriers of APOE2/3 genotype had lower markers of impaired BCAA katabolism, including tiglyl carnitine, methylmalonate and 3-methylglutaconate. In summary, these results suggest a potential involvement of the APOE2 genotype in BCAA utilization in the TCA cycle and nominate these humanized APOE mouse models for further study of APOE in AD, brain aging, and brain BCAA utilization for energy. We have previously shown lower plasma BCAA to be associated with incident dementia, and their higher levels in brain with AD pathology and cognitive impairment. Those findings together with our current results could potentially explain the AD-protective effect of APOE2 genotype by enabling higher utilization of BCAA for energy during the decline of fatty acid β-oxidation.

Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer's disease.	"Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is an early presymptomatic manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with symptom-free periods of varying duration that likely reflect individual differences in metabolic resilience. We propose a systemic ""bioenergetic capacity"", the individual ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions. Using fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative as a blood-based readout for this capacity, we identified subgroups with distinct clinical and biomarker presentations of AD. Our data suggests that improving beta-oxidation efficiency can decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. The estimated treatment effects of targeting the bioenergetic capacity were comparable to those of recently approved anti-amyloid therapies, particularly in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that therapeutically enhancing bioenergetic health may reduce the risk of symptomatic AD. Furthermore, monitoring the bioenergetic capacity via blood acylcarnitine measurements can be achieved using existing clinical assays."

Rescue of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory performance by Fingolimod (FTY720) in APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by correction in metabolism of sphingolipids, polyamines, and phospholipid saturation composition.	"Previously, our metabolomic, transcriptomic, and genomic studies characterized the ceramide/sphingomyelin pathway as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, and we demonstrated that FTY720, a sphingosine-1-phospahate receptor modulator approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis, recovers synaptic plasticity and memory in APP/PS1 mice. To further investigate how FTY720 rescues the pathology, we performed metabolomic analysis in brain, plasma, and liver of trained APP/PS1 and wild-type mice. APP/PS1 mice showed area-specific brain disturbances in polyamines, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. Most changes were completely or partially normalized in FTY720-treated subjects, indicating rebalancing the ""sphingolipid rheostat"", reactivating phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis via mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase pathway, and normalizing polyamine levels that support mitochondrial activity. Synaptic plasticity and memory were rescued, with spermidine synthesis in temporal cortex best corresponding to hippocampal CA3-CA1 plasticity normalization. FTY720 effects, also reflected in other pathways, are consistent with promotion of mitochondrial function, synaptic plasticity, and anti-inflammatory environment, while reducing pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory signals."

The blood metabolome of cognitive function and brain health in middle-aged adults - influences of genes, gut microbiome, and exposome.	Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of metabolic alterations in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and highlights the significance of the peripheral metabolome, influenced by genetic factors and modifiable environmental exposures, for brain health. In this study, we examined 1,387 metabolites in plasma samples from 1,082 dementia-free middle-aged participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study. We assessed the relation of metabolites with general cognition (G-factor) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers using linear regression and estimated the variance of these metabolites explained by genes, gut microbiome, lifestyle factors, common clinical comorbidities, and medication using gradient boosting decision tree analysis. Twenty-one metabolites and one metabolite were significantly associated with total brain volume and total white matter lesions, respectively.

Comparative brain metabolomics reveals shared and distinct metabolic alterations in Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy.	Metabolic dysregulation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Although metabolic dysregulation is a common link between these two tauopathies, a comprehensive brain metabolic comparison of the diseases has not yet been performed. We analyzed 342 postmortem brain samples from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank and examined 658 metabolites in the cerebellar cortex and the temporal cortex between the two tauopathies. Our findings indicate that both diseases display oxidative stress associated with lipid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction linked to lysine metabolism, and an indication of tau-induced polyamine stress response. However, specific to AD, we detected glutathione-related neuroinflammation, deregulations of enzymes tied to purines, and cognitive deficits associated with vitamin B. Our findings underscore vast alterations in the brain's metabolome, illuminating shared neurodegenerative pathways and disease-specific traits in AD and PSP. First high-throughput metabolic comparison of Alzheimer's diesease (AD) versus progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in brain tissue. Cerebellar cortex (CER) shows substantial AD-related metabolic changes, despite limited proteinopathy. AD impacts both CER and temporal cortex (TCX); PSP's changes are primarily in CER. AD and PSP share metabolic alterations despite major pathological differences.

Uncovering neural substrates across Alzheimer's disease stages using contrastive variational autoencoder.	Alzheimer's disease is the most common major neurocognitive disorder. Although currently, no cure exists, understanding the neurobiological substrate underlying Alzheimer's disease progression will facilitate early diagnosis and treatment, slow disease progression, and improve prognosis. In this study, we aimed to understand the morphological changes underlying Alzheimer's disease progression using structural magnetic resonance imaging data from cognitively normal individuals, individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease via a contrastive variational autoencoder model. We used contrastive variational autoencoder to generate synthetic data to boost the downstream classification performance. Due to the ability to parse out the nonclinical factors such as age and gender, contrastive variational autoencoder facilitated a purer comparison between different Alzheimer's disease stages to identify the pathological changes specific to Alzheimer's disease progression. We showed that brain morphological changes across Alzheimer's disease stages were significantly associated with individuals' neurofilament light chain concentration, a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the biological plausibility of our results.

Dynamic functional network connectivity and its association with lipid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.	The study aims to examine the changing trajectory characteristics of dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) and its correlation with lipid metabolism-related factors across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum populations. Data from 242 AD spectrum subjects, including biological, neuroimaging, and general cognition, were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative for this cross-sectional study. The study utilized a sliding-window approach to assess whole-brain dFNC, investigating group differences and associations with biological and cognitive factors. Abnormal dFNC was used in the classification of AD spectrum populations by support vector machine. Mediation analysis was performed to explore the relationships between lipid-related indicators, dFNC, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and cognitive performance. Significant group difference concerning were observed in relation to APOE-ε4 status, CSF biomarkers, and cognitive scores. Two reoccurring connectivity states were identified: state-1 characterized by frequent but weak connections, and state-II characterized by less frequent but strong connections. Pre-AD subjects exhibited a preference for spending more time in state-I, whereas AD patients tended remain in state-II for longer periods. Group difference in dFNC was primarily found between AD and non-AD participants within each state. The dFNC of state-I yielded strong power to distinguish AD from other groups compared with state-II. APOE-ε4 The dysfunction of dFNC temporal-spatial patterns and increased cognition in individuals with APOE-ε4, high polygenic score, and higher serum lipid levels shed light on the lipid-related mechanisms of dynamic network reorganization in AD.

A Novel Score to Predict Individual Risk for Future Alzheimer's Disease: A Longitudinal Study of the ADNI Cohort.	Identifying high-risk individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are likely to progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for early intervention. This study aimed to develop and validate a novel clinical score for personalized estimation of MCI-to-AD conversion. The data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study were analyzed. Two-thirds of the MCI patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort (n = 478), and the remaining one-third formed the validation cohort (n = 239). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with MCI-to-AD progression within 4 years. A prediction score was developed based on the regression coefficients derived from the logistic model and tested in the validation cohort. A lipidomics-signature was obtained that showed a significant association with disease progression. The MCI conversion scoring system (ranged from 0 to 14 points), consisting of the lipidomics-signature and five other significant variables (Apolipoprotein ɛ4, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test immediate and delayed recall, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale delayed recall test, Functional Activities Questionnaire, and cortical thickness of the AD signature), was constructed. Higher conversion scores were associated with a higher proportion of patients converting to AD. The scoring system demonstrated good discrimination and calibration in both the training cohort (AUC = 0.879, p of Hosmer-Lemeshow test = 0.597) and the validation cohort (AUC = 0.915, p of Hosmer-Lemeshow test = 0.991). The risk classification achieved excellent sensitivity (0.84) and specificity (0.75). The MCI-to-AD conversion score is a reliable tool for predicting the risk of disease progression in individuals with MCI.

Foot care behaviours and associated factors among patients with type 2 diabetes: A cross-sectional study.	As numerous studies highlighted the importance of maintaining proper foot care (FC) behaviours among individuals with diabetes to prevent complications, we sought to assess FC behaviours among patients with diabetes and to identify the factors associated with the practice of diabetic FC. We used a cross-sectional design and collected data through self-reported questionnaires administered to a sample of 586 patients from five medical centres. We conducted descriptive and inferential analyses to explore the relationships between potential risk and protective factors and FC behaviours. Overall, 429 individuals (73.2%) had good FC behaviours, while 157 (26.8%) displayed poor FC behaviours. Furthermore, we identified eight influencing factors on FC behaviours, including smoking status, the availability of a caregiver, the presence of diabetic foot ulcers, amputation history, FC knowledge, subjective norms in diabetes self-care behaviour, diabetes-related stress, and quality of life index values. The logistic regression analysis showed that current smokers were 60% less likely to practice good FC compared to non-smokers (odds ratio (OR) = 0.40; 95%; confidence interval (CI) = 0.22-0.73). Having a caregiver decreased the likelihood of practicing good FC by 50% (OR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.33-0.84), while having diabetic foot ulcers doubled it (OR = 2.65; 95% CI = 1.26-5.54). Additionally, more FC knowledge increased the likelihood by 20% (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.10-1.33), and higher diabetes-related stress increased it by 1.03 times (OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.02-1.05). Our findings underscore the interplay of various factors influencing FC behaviours among individuals with diabetes and call for targeted interventions and tailored strategies to improve FC practices in this vulnerable population.

An NMR measurement in plasma, glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA), captures the overall level of protein production and glycosylation implicated in systemic inflammation. With its additional advantage of reducing biological variability, GlycA might be useful in monitoring the relationship between peripheral inflammation and brain changes relevant to AD. However, the associations between GlycA and these brain changes have not been fully evaluated. Here, we performed Spearman's correlation analyses to evaluate these associations cross-sectionally and determined whether GlycA can inform AD-relevant longitudinal measurements among participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 1506), with additional linear models and stratification analyses to evaluate the influences of sex or diagnosis status and confirm findings from Spearman's correlation analyses. We found that GlycA was elevated in AD patients compared to cognitively normal participants. GlycA correlated negatively with multiple concurrent regional brain volumes in females diagnosed with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) or AD. Baseline GlycA level was associated with executive function decline at 3-9 year follow-up in participants diagnosed with LMCI at baseline, with similar but not identical trends observed in the future decline of memory and entorhinal cortex volume. Results here indicated that GlycA is an inflammatory biomarker relevant to AD pathogenesis and that the stage of LMCI might be relevant to inflammation-related intervention.

Effect of a two-only-meals-a-day and exercise lifestyle on HbA1c and anti-diabetic medication in a follow-up study of subjects with type 2 diabetes attending a free clinic in a north Maharashtra city.	Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a global challenge with rising prevalence, inadequate compliance, and poor outcomes. Assess the effect of a 2-only-daily-meals with exercise lifestyle (2-OMEX) on (a) HbA1c, (b) anti-diabetic medication count (ADMC), (c) Kcal intakes, body weight, fasting insulin, and subjective well-being. This is a single-arm follow-up study conducted in a free 2-OMEX clinic in 2019-2020. Information for two meals and exercise compliance was obtained during the clinic visit. HbA1c was tested by HPLC and fasting insulin by the CLIA/CMIA method in private laboratories. Eligible subjects (f = 49, m = 116) completing two or more visits and 60 days of follow-up had a mean age of 55.92 (10.43) years, a T2D duration of 8.20 (6.28) years, and a median observation period of 140 days. Statistically significant changes included HbA1c decline from 7.69 (1.70) to 7.00 (1.20) gm% (equivalent by the LogNormal method to 1.088 gm%), average weight loss at 5%(m), and 2%(f). ADMC declined from 2.32 to 2.14, the difference being significant with the WSR test (z = 2.0087, The 2-OMEX lifestyle showed a sizeable, favorable, and significant change in HbA1c, body weight, ADMC use in five months, and subjective benefits.

Multiomics analysis to explore blood metabolite biomarkers in an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that commonly causes dementia. Identifying biomarkers for the early detection of AD is an emerging need, as brain dysfunction begins two decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. To this end, we reanalyzed untargeted metabolomic mass spectrometry data from 905 patients enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort using MS-DIAL, with 1,304,633 spectra of 39,108 unique biomolecules. Metabolic profiles of 93 hydrophilic metabolites were determined. Additionally, we integrated targeted lipidomic data (4873 samples from 1524 patients) to explore candidate biomarkers for predicting progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) in patients diagnosed with AD within two years using the baseline metabolome. Patients with lower ergothioneine levels had a 12% higher rate of AD progression with the significance of P = 0.012 (Wald test). Furthermore, an increase in ganglioside (GM3) and decrease in plasmalogen lipids, many of which are associated with apolipoprotein E polymorphism, were confirmed in AD patients, and the higher levels of lysophosphatidylcholine (18:1) and GM3 d18:1/20:0 showed 19% and 17% higher rates of AD progression, respectively (Wald test: P = 3.9 × 10

Increased Cortical Thickness in Alzheimer's Disease.	Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have diffuse brain atrophy, but some regions, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), are spared and may even show increase in size compared to controls. The extent, clinical significance, and mechanisms associated with increased cortical thickness in AD remain unknown. Recent work suggested neural facilitation of regions anticorrelated to atrophied regions in frontotemporal dementia. Here, we aim to determine whether increased thickness occurs in sporadic AD, whether it relates to clinical symptoms, and whether it occur in brain regions functionally connected to-but anticorrelated with-locations of atrophy. Cross-sectional clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were analyzed to investigate cortical thickness in AD subjects versus controls. Atrophy network mapping was used to identify brain regions functionally connected to locations of increased thickness and atrophy. AD patients showed increased thickness in the ACC in a region-of-interest analysis and the visual cortex in an exploratory analysis. Increased thickness in the left ACC was associated with preserved cognitive function, while increased thickness in the left visual cortex was associated with hallucinations. Finally, we found that locations of increased thickness were functionally connected to, but anticorrelated with, locations of brain atrophy (r = -0.81, p < 0.05). Our results suggest that increased cortical thickness in Alzheimer's disease is relevant to AD symptoms and preferentially occur in brain regions functionally connected to, but anticorrelated with, areas of brain atrophy. Implications for models of compensatory neuroplasticity in response to neurodegeneration are discussed. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:929-940.

Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer's disease.	Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is one of the earliest presymptomatic manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The absence of symptoms for extended periods of time suggests that compensatory metabolic mechanisms can provide resilience. Here, we introduce the concept of a systemic 'bioenergetic capacity' as the innate ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions, potentially serving as such a compensatory mechanism. We argue that fasting blood acylcarnitine profiles provide an approximate peripheral measure for this capacity that mirrors bioenergetic dysregulation in the brain. Using unsupervised subgroup identification, we show that fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles of participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative yields bioenergetically distinct subgroups with significant differences in AD biomarker profiles and cognitive function. To assess the potential clinical relevance of this finding, we examined factors that may offer diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. First, we identified a genotype affecting the bioenergetic capacity which was linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism and significantly modulated the rate of future cognitive decline. Second, a potentially modifiable influence of beta-oxidation efficiency seemed to decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. Our findings, which are supported by data from more than 9,000 individuals, suggest that interventions tailored to enhance energetic health and to slow bioenergetic aging could mitigate the risk of symptomatic AD, especially in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes.

Addressing this problem, we introduce a novel high-performing attention-based dehazing model (ADMC2-net)that successfully incorporates both RGB and HSV color spaces to maintain color properties. This model consists of two parallel densely connected sub-models (RGB and HSV) followed by a new efficient attention module. This attention module comprises pixel-attention and channel-attention mechanisms to get more haze-relevant features.

Serum Bile Acids Improve Prediction of Alzheimer's Progression in a Sex-Dependent Manner.	Sex disparities in serum bile acid (BA) levels and Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence have been established. However, the precise link between changes in serum BAs and AD development remains elusive. Here, authors quantitatively determined 33 serum BAs and 58 BA features in 4 219 samples collected from 1 180 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The findings revealed that these BA features exhibited significant correlations with clinical stages, encompassing cognitively normal (CN), early and late mild cognitive impairment, and AD, as well as cognitive performance. Importantly, these associations are more pronounced in men than women. Among participants with progressive disease stages (n = 660), BAs underwent early changes in men, occurring before AD. By incorporating BA features into diagnostic and predictive models, positive enhancements are achieved for all models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve improved from 0.78 to 0.91 for men and from 0.76 to 0.83 for women for the differentiation of CN and AD. Additionally, the key findings are validated in a subset of participants (n = 578) with cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta and tau levels. These findings underscore the role of BAs in AD progression, offering potential improvements in the accuracy of AD prediction.	alzheimer's disease; bile acid; cholesterol; mild cognitive impairment; sex difference

Deep learning has shown potential in various scientific domains but faces challenges when applied to complex, high-dimensional multi-omics data. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that lacks targeted therapeutic options. This study introduces the Circular-Sliding Window Association Test (c-SWAT) to improve the classification accuracy in predicting AD using serum-based metabolomics data, specifically lipidomics. The c-SWAT methodology builds upon the existing Sliding Window Association Test (SWAT) and utilizes a three-step approach: feature correlation analysis, feature selection, and classification. Data from 997 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) served as the basis for model training and validation. Feature correlations were analyzed using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were employed for feature selection. Random Forest was used for the final classification. The application of c-SWAT resulted in a classification accuracy of up to 80.8% and an AUC of 0.808 for distinguishing AD from cognitively normal older adults. This marks a 9.4% improvement in accuracy and a 0.169 increase in AUC compared to methods without c-SWAT. These results were statistically significant, with a p-value of 1.04 × 10ˆ-4. The approach also identified key lipids associated with AD, such as Cer(d16:1/22:0) and PI(37:6). Our results indicate that c-SWAT is effective in improving classification accuracy and in identifying potential lipid biomarkers for AD. These identified lipids offer new avenues for understanding AD and warrant further investigation. The specific funding of this article is provided in the acknowledgements section.

Comparative brain metabolomics reveals shared and distinct metabolic alterations in Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy.	Metabolic dysregulation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). While metabolic dysregulation is a common link between these two tauopathies, a comprehensive brain metabolic comparison of the diseases has not yet been performed. We analyzed 342 postmortem brain samples from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank and examined 658 metabolites in the cerebellar cortex and the temporal cortex between the two tauopathies. Our findings indicate that both diseases display oxidative stress associated with lipid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction linked to lysine metabolism, and an indication of tau-induced polyamine stress response. However, specific to AD, we detected glutathione-related neuroinflammation, deregulations of enzymes tied to purines, and cognitive deficits associated with vitamin B. Taken together, our findings underscore vast alterations in the brain's metabolome, illuminating shared neurodegenerative pathways and disease-specific traits in AD and PSP.

Serum unsaturated phosphatidylcholines predict longitudinal basal forebrain degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.	Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are among the first cell types affected by Alzheimer's disease pathology, but the cause of their early vulnerability is unknown. The lipid phosphatidylcholine is an essential component of the cell membrane, and phosphatidylcholine levels have been shown to be abnormal in the blood and brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. We hypothesized that disease-related changes in phosphatidylcholine metabolism may disproportionately affect basal forebrain cholinergic neurons due to their extremely large size, plasticity in adulthood and unique reliance on phosphatidylcholine for acetylcholine synthesis. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether serum phosphatidylcholine levels predicted longitudinal basal forebrain degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. All data were collected by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

In Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), identifying a high risk of conversion to Alzheimer's Disease Dementia (AD) is a primary goal for patient management. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are widely employed to pursue data-driven diagnostic and prognostic goals. An agreement on the stability of these algorithms -when applied to different biomarkers and other conditions- is far from being reached. In this study, we compared the different prognostic performances of three supervised ML algorithms fed with multimodal biomarkers of MCI subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithms predict MCI conversion to AD. They can also be simultaneously employed -with the voting procedure- to improve predictivity. AD prediction accuracy is influenced by the nature of the data (i.e., neuropsychological test scores, cerebrospinal fluid AD-related proteins and APOE ε4, cerebral structural MRI (sMRI) data). In our study, independent of the applied ML algorithms, sMRI data showed the lowest accuracy (0.79) compared to other classes. Multimodal data were helpful in the algorithms' performances by combining clinical and biological measures. Accordingly, using the three ML algorithms, the highest accuracy (0.90) was reached by employing neuropsychological and AD-related biomarkers. Finally, the feature selection procedure indicated that the most critical variables in the respective classes were the ADAS-Cog-13 scale, the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus atrophy, and the ratio between phosphorylated Tau and Aβ42 proteins. In conclusion, our data support the notion that using multiple ML algorithms and multimodal biomarkers helps make more accurate and solid predictions.

Understanding the dynamics of fluid-structure interaction with an Air Deflected Microfluidic Chip (ADMC).	A deformable microfluidic system and a fluidic dynamic model have been successfully coupled to understand the dynamic fluid-structure interaction in transient flow, designed to understand the dentine hypersensitivity caused by hydrodynamic theory. The Polydimethylsiloxane thin sidewalls of the microfluidic chip are deformed with air pressure ranging from 50 to 500 mbar to move the liquid meniscus in the central liquid channel. The experiments show that the meniscus sharply increased in the first 10th of second and the increase is nonlinearly proportional to the applied pressure. A theoretical model is developed based on the unsteady Bernoulli equation and can well predict the ending point of the liquid displacement as well as the dynamics process, regardless of the wall thickness. Moreover, an overshooting and oscillation phenomenon is observed by reducing the head loss coefficient by a few orders which could be the key to explain the dentine hypersensitivity caused by the liquid movement in the dentine tubules.

Metabolomic and lipidomic signatures in autosomal dominant and late-onset Alzheimer's disease brains.	The identification of multiple genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggests that many pathways contribute to AD onset and progression. However, the metabolomic and lipidomic profiles in carriers of distinct genetic risk factors are not fully understood. The metabolome can provide a direct image of dysregulated pathways in the brain. We interrogated metabolomic signatures in the AD brain, including carriers of pathogenic variants in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 (autosomal dominant AD; ADAD), APOE ɛ4, and TREM2 risk variant carriers, and sporadic AD (sAD). We identified 133 unique and shared metabolites associated with ADAD, TREM2, and sAD. We identified a signature of 16 metabolites significantly altered between groups and associated with AD duration. AD genetic variants show distinct metabolic perturbations. Investigation of these metabolites may provide greater insight into the etiology of AD and its impact on clinical presentation. APP/PSEN1/PSEN2 and TREM2 variant carriers show distinct metabolic changes. A total of 133 metabolites were differentially abundant in AD genetic groups. β-citrylglutamate is differentially abundant in autosomal dominant, TREM2, and sporadic AD. A 16-metabolite profile shows differences between Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic groups. The identified metabolic profile is associated with duration of disease.

Multi-Omic analyses characterize the ceramide/sphingomyelin pathway as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.	Dysregulation of sphingomyelin and ceramide metabolism have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association studies have identified various genes and genetic variants in lipid metabolism that are associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, the molecular mechanisms of sphingomyelin and ceramide disruption remain to be determined. We focus on the sphingolipid pathway and carry out multi-omics analyses to identify central and peripheral metabolic changes in Alzheimer's patients, correlating them to imaging features. Our multi-omics approach is based on (a) 2114 human post-mortem brain transcriptomics to identify differentially expressed genes; (b) in silico metabolic flux analysis on context-specific metabolic networks identified differential reaction fluxes; (c) multimodal neuroimaging analysis on 1576 participants to associate genetic variants in sphingomyelin pathway with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis; (d) plasma metabolomic and lipidomic analysis to identify associations of lipid species with dysregulation in Alzheimer's; and (e) metabolite genome-wide association studies to define receptors within the pathway as a potential drug target. We validate our hypothesis in amyloidogenic APP/PS1 mice and show prolonged exposure to fingolimod alleviated synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment in mice. Our integrative multi-omics approach identifies potential targets in the sphingomyelin pathway and suggests modulators of S1P metabolism as possible candidates for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

Integrating multi-omics summary data using a Mendelian randomization framework.	Mendelian randomization is a versatile tool to identify the possible causal relationship between an omics biomarker and disease outcome using genetic variants as instrumental variables. A key theme is the prioritization of genes whose omics readouts can be used as predictors of the disease outcome through analyzing GWAS and QTL summary data. However, there is a dearth of study of the best practice in probing the effects of multiple -omics biomarkers annotated to the same gene of interest. To bridge this gap, we propose powerful combination tests that integrate multiple correlated $P$-values without assuming the dependence structure between the exposures. Our extensive simulation experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared with existing methods that are adapted to the setting of our interest. The top hits of the analyses of multi-omics Alzheimer's disease datasets include genes ABCA7 and ATP1B1.	GWAS; Mendelian randomization; QTL; multi-omics data

The landscape of metabolic brain alterations in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by metabolic alterations both in the periphery and the central nervous system. However, so far, a global view of AD-associated metabolic changes in the brain has been missing. We metabolically profiled 500 samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Metabolite levels were correlated with eight clinical parameters, covering both late-life cognitive performance and AD neuropathology measures. We observed widespread metabolic dysregulation associated with AD, spanning 298 metabolites from various AD-relevant pathways. These included alterations to bioenergetics, cholesterol metabolism, neuroinflammation, and metabolic consequences of neurotransmitter ratio imbalances. Our findings further suggest impaired osmoregulation as a potential pathomechanism in AD. Finally, inspecting the interplay of proteinopathies provided evidence that metabolic associations were largely driven by tau pathology rather than amyloid beta pathology. This work provides a comprehensive reference map of metabolic brain changes in AD that lays the foundation for future mechanistic follow-up studies.

Identification and Characterization of Tunneling Nanotubes Involved in Human Mast Cell FcεRI-Mediated Apoptosis of Cancer Cells.	Mast cells (MCs) are found in practically all tissues where they participate in innate and adaptive immune responses. They are also found in and around tumors, yet their interactions with cancer cells and the resulting impact on cancer cell growth and metastasis are not well understood. In this study, we examined a novel mechanism of IgE-FcεRI-mediated, intercellular communication between human adipose-derived mast cells (ADMC) and cancer cells. The formation of heterotypic tunneling nanotubes (TnT) and membrane structures between MCs and tumor cells in vitro was examined using microscopy and a diverse array of molecule-specific indicator dyes. We show that several MC-specific structures are dependent on the specific interactions between human tumor IgE-sensitized MCs and antigens on the tumor cell surface. The formation of TnT, membrane blebs and other MC-specific structures paralleled FcεRI-degranulation occurring within 30 min and persisting for up to 24 h. The TnT-specific adhesion of FcεRI-activated MCs to tumor cells was characterized by the transport of the MC granule content into the tumor cells, including tryptase and TNF-α. This interaction led to apoptosis of the tumor cells, which differs from previous studies examining tissue cells within the cancer microenvironment. The formation of heterotypic TnT results in stimulation of an invasive tumor cell phenotype and increased tumor cell invasion and chemoresistance of the cancer cells. These studies describe a heretofore-unrecognized mechanism underlying IgE-mediated interactions and FcεRI-activated MC-mediated killing of tumor cells through the formation of TnT.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been shown to be associated with cognitive decline and dementia. As earlier onset of diabetes implies a longer disease duration and an increased risk to complications, we sought to investigate the effect of T2DM onset on cognitive function of our patients. We administered the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) to T2DM patients aged 45-85 from our SMART2D cohort. We assessed the association of the T2DM onset age (both continuous and stratified into 3 groups: early-onset ≤40 (n = 326), middle-aged onset 41-64 (n = 703) and late-onset ≥65 years old (n = 38)) and RBANS cognitive indices in 1067 patients. Potential mediation of this association by vascular compliance using mediation analysis was investigated. T2DM onset associates significantly with RBANS total score. Patients with early T2DM onset have lower RBANS total score as compared to patients with middle-aged onset (β = -2.01, p = 0.0102) and those with late-onset (β = -5.80, p = 0.005). This association was partially mediated by pulse pressure index (25.8%), with indirect effect of 0.028 (Bootstrapped-CI: 0.008-0.047). Association of early-onset T2DM with cognitive impairment is partly mediated by diminished vascular compliance. Appropriate screening and assessment of cognitive function is important for early intervention and management of cognitive impairment.

Predictive metabolic networks reveal sex- and APOE genotype-specific metabolic signatures and drivers for precision medicine in Alzheimer's disease.	Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease characterized by multiple progressive stages, glucose metabolic dysregulation, Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and inexorable cognitive decline. Discovery of metabolic profiles unique to sex, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and stage of disease progression could provide critical insights for personalized LOAD medicine. Sex- and APOE-specific metabolic networks were constructed based on changes in 127 metabolites of 656 serum samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Application of an advanced analytical platform identified metabolic drivers and signatures clustered with sex and/or APOE ɛ4, establishing patient-specific biomarkers predictive of disease state that significantly associated with cognitive function. Presence of the APOE ɛ4 shifts metabolic signatures to a phosphatidylcholine-focused profile overriding sex-specific differences in serum metabolites of AD patients. These findings provide an initial but critical step in developing a diagnostic platform for personalized medicine by integrating metabolomic profiling and cognitive assessments to identify targeted precision therapeutics for AD patient subgroups through computational network modeling.

Evaluating the immune effector functions induced by humanized anti-CD99 antibody in eliminating T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cells.	Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as targeted immunotherapies with clinical effectiveness and low adverse effects for various cancers. However, antibody drugs for treating aggressive T cell malignancies, T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/T-LBL), are still limited. Therefore, a potential mAb for treating T-ALL/T-LBL with minimal toxicity to normal cells needs to be developed. We have previously demonstrated that our in-house produced mouse anti-human CD99 mAb MT99/3 and its humanized version, HuMT99/3, which recognize a newly identified epitope of CD99 can induce apoptosis of T-ALL/T-LBL cells without affecting non-malignant peripheral blood cells. Nevertheless, the immune effector functions activated by HuMT99/3 against T-ALL/T-LBL cells remain unexplored. In this study, we evaluated the anticancer activities of HuMT99/3 against T-ALL/T-LBL cells via immune effector functions. T-ALL/T-LBL cell lines were used as target cells, including Jurkat E6.1, MOLT-4, and SUP-T1. The results demonstrated that HuMT99/3 could mediate potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity to kill all cell lines by activating the Fc receptor CD16 on effector cells. HuMT99/3 significantly enhanced the phagocytosis of monocytes on all three malignant T cell lines through antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activity. In addition, HuMT99/3 could activate complement to destroy T-ALL cell lines through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity, without affecting the T-LBL cell line and normal PBMCs. Furthermore, the mAb MT99/3 significantly inhibited tumor growth in a T-ALL xenograft model. These findings provide valuable insights into the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting CD99 as promising therapeutics for T-ALL/T-LBL treatment with minimal toxicity to normal peripheral blood cells.

An antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis-related gene signature predicts survival and response to immunotherapy in stomach adenocarcinoma.	Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) is an immune biological process and plays a biological role in the clearance of tumor cells and the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the effects of ADCP on stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) remain unclear. Clinical and genomic data were extracted from multiple datasets. The ADCP-related signature was established using Cox least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Expression of the C5a receptor also known as complement component 5a receptor 1 in the tumor and adjacent-normal tissues was calculated using immunohistochemistry staining. Validation of the signature was conducted in the training and validation cohorts by Cox regression and log-rank tests. Furthermore, the immune infiltrates, the tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion score, and tumor mutation burden score were calculated using the corresponding algorithms, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to evaluate the differences between groups. Seventy-three hub genes with predictive performance were identified to establish an ADCP-related signature. Accordingly, a 27-gene signature was established, C5a receptor also known as complement component 5a receptor 1, one of the signature genes, had higher expression in tumors than adjacent-normal samples, and its predictive performance was validated in the GSE84437 and The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. We found that the ADCP-related signature is an excellent prognostic predictor of STAD. Moreover, the molecular characteristics and some indices of response to immunotherapy differed between the high- and low-risk groups. We constructed a 27-gene signature that is associated with the prognosis and response to STAD-based immunotherapy and provide insights into the biological mechanisms underlying this predictive function.

However, it is difficult to achieve highly selective targeting of cancer cells while minimizing toxicity on healthy tissue because of the expression of most receptors, albeit at lower levels, on non-cancer cells. Previous attempts to increase the selectivity of antibody-mediated effector functions have sought to reduce binding affinity and/or increase avidity, which typically results in modest improvements in selectivity. To overcome this limitation, we report the use of mixtures of antibody variants that achieve high selectivity based on receptor level while maintaining high activity for cells with high receptor levels. We have studied mixtures of two variants of an anti-HER2 antibody (trastuzumab), one that is affinity-reduced and effector-competent and a second high-affinity variant that is effectorless. Notably, we observe that the high-affinity, effectorless antibody reduces effector function for cells with low receptor levels, including reduced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP), while the high-avidity, effector-competent antibody mediates significant effector function for cells with high receptor levels. Moreover, replacing the effector-competent Fc region of the affinity-reduced antibody with high-affinity Fc domains that enhance effector function drives high activity while maintaining high selectivity for the antibody mixtures. These findings outline a general strategy for maximizing the therapeutic window by selectively targeting cancer cells based on receptor levels that could be applied to a wide range of applications involving antibody-mediated synapse formation, including antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies, such as T cell engagers.

Effective extracellular payload release and immunomodulatory interactions govern the therapeutic effect of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd).	Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting HER2, exhibiting significant clinical efficacy in breast cancer (BC) with varying HER2 expression, including HER2-low and HER2-ultralow. However, the precise mechanism underlying its efficacy and the contribution of immune activation in these settings remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that T-DXd efficacy in HER2-low and HER2-negative BC is independent of HER2 engagement and ADC internalization. Instead, its activity relies on extracellular proteases, such as cathepsin L (CTSL), within the tumor microenvironment. Irrespective of their HER2 status, tumor and stromal compartments of invasive BC abundantly express CTSL, which efficiently cleaves the specialized linker of T-DXd, facilitating payload release and inducing cytotoxicity against HER2-low/negative tumors. In HER2-positive BC, the antibody backbone of T-DXd engages Fcγ-receptors and drives antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Concurrently, its cytotoxic payload (DXd) induces immunogenic cell death, further activating myeloid cells via TLR4 and STING pathways to enhance tumor antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. Notably, T-DXd cytotoxicity also upregulates tumor CD47 expression, dampening immune activation. Combining T-DXd with CD47 checkpoint blockade significantly enhances anti-tumor immune responses in a HER2-transgenic BC mouse model, while also inducing durable CD8+ T cell memory to prevent tumor recurrence after therapy cessation.

Antibody effector functions contribute to the immune response to pathogens and can influence the efficacy of antibodies as therapeutics. To date, however, there is limited information on the molecular parameters that govern fragment crystallizable (Fc) effector functions. In this study, using AI-assisted protein design, the influences of binding kinetics, epitope location, and stoichiometry of binding on cellular Fc effector functions were investigated using engineered HIV-1 envelope as a model antigen. For this antigen, stoichiometry of binding was found to be the primary molecular determinant of FcγRIIIa signaling, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, while epitope location and antibodybinding kinetics, at least in the ranges investigated, were of no substantial impact. These findings are of importance for informing the development of vaccination strategies against HIV-1 and, possibly, other viral pathogens.

Development and Characterization of 4A7: A High-Affinity Monoclonal Antibody Targeting Claudin18.2.	Claudin18.2 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target due to its high expression in gastric (GC) and pancreatic cancers (PC). However, patients with advanced, unresectable, or metastatic GC or PC face poor prognoses, highlighting the urgent need for more effective Claudin18.2-targeted therapies. We developed 4A7, a fully human monoclonal antibody with superior affinity and specificity for Claudin18.2, using a rigorous positive and negative screening strategy to eliminate cross-reactivity with Claudin18.1. In vitro, 4A7 demonstrated significantly enhanced binding activity, as well as robust antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), outperforming IMAB362, a clinical investigational antibody. In vivo, 4A7 exhibited remarkable tumor growth inhibition both as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-mPD-1, achieving superior efficacy compared to IMAB362. Additionally, 4A7 demonstrated a higher degree of humanization and comparable stability, supporting its translational potential. 4A7 shows great promise as a next-generation therapeutic for Claudin18.2-positive cancers, offering improved efficacy and reduced immunogenicity. This study not only highlights 4A7's potential to address unmet clinical needs but also provides a foundation for future innovations in monoclonal antibody-based cancer therapy.

Fc-mediated immune stimulating, pro-inflammatory and antitumor effects of anti-HER2 IgE against HER2-expressing and trastuzumab-resistant tumors.	Anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) IgG1-based antibody therapies significantly improve cancer prognosis, yet intrinsic or acquired resistance to fragment antigen-binding (Fab)-mediated direct effects commonly occurs. Most resistant tumors retain antigen expression and therefore remain potentially targetable with anti-HER2 therapies that promote immune-mediated responses. Tumor-antigen-specific IgE class antibodies can mediate powerful immune cell-mediated effects against different cancers and have been shown to activate IgE Fc receptor-expressing monocytes. We previously reported the engineering of a trastuzumab-equivalent anti-HER2 IgE antibody and showed early evidence of Fc-mediated cancer cell-targeting effects. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-tumoral functions of two anti-HER2 IgEs, trastuzumab and pertuzumab IgE. In vitro functionality of the two anti-HER2 antibodies was assessed by HER2 phosphorylation and ligand-independent viability assays, as well as basophil (RBL-SX38) degranulation, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity/antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis(ADCC/ADCP) assays and primary monocyte stimulation assays. The potential to trigger a hypersensitivity type I reaction was investigated using the basophil activation test (BAT). anti-tumoral efficacy was assessed in two humanized HER2+, trastuzumab-resistant models in vivo. Changes in the tumor microenvironment were assessed by flow cytometry or bulk RNA sequencing. We demonstrate the anti-tumoral and immunostimulatory functions of two anti-HER2 IgEs derived from variable region sequences of the clinically available trastuzumab and pertuzumab IgG1 antibodies. IgE engagement of monocytes via the Fc region induced tumor cell cytotoxicity and a pro-inflammatory shift with upregulation of immune-stimulatory CD40, CD80 and CD86, and downregulation of scavenger CD163, cell surface molecules. This was accompanied by enhanced pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β cytokine production. The absence of basophil activation by anti-HER2 IgEs ex vivo in whole blood points to potentially safe administration in humans. In two trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ tumor xenograft models in immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human immune cells, the trastuzumab-equivalent anti-HER2 IgE restricted tumor growth. Treatment was associated with enriched classical (CD14 Collectively, anti-HER2 IgE maintains Fab-mediated antitumor activity, induces Fc-mediated effects against HER2-expressing tumor cells, and stimulates remodeling of the immune microenvironment in tumors to promote pro-inflammatory cell phenotypes which could translate to improved outcomes for patients.

Comparison of human macrophages derived from peripheral blood and bone marrow.	Macrophage differentiation, phenotype, and function have been assessed extensively in vitro by predominantly deriving human macrophages from peripheral blood. It is accepted that there are differences between macrophages isolated from different human tissues; however, the importance of anatomical source for in vitro differentiation and characterization is less clear. Here, phenotype and function were evaluated between human macrophages derived from bone marrow or peripheral blood. Macrophages were differentiated by adherence of heterogenous cell populations or CD14 isolation and polarized with IFNγ and LPS or IL-4 and IL-13 for 48 hours before evaluation of phenotype and phagocytic capacity. The presence of stromal cells in bone marrow heterogenous cultures resulted in a reduction in macrophage purity compared to peripheral blood, which was negated after CD14 isolation. Phenotypically, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) derived from peripheral blood and bone marrow resulted in similar expression of classical and polarized macrophages markers, including CD14, HLA-DR, CD38, and CD40 (increased after IFNγ/LPS), and CD11b and CD206 (elevated after IL-4/IL-13). Functionally, these cells also showed similar levels of Fc-independent and Fc-dependent phagocytosis, although there was a nonsignificant reduction of Fc-dependent phagocytosis in the bone marrow derived macrophages after IFNγ/LPS stimulation. In summary, we have identified that human MDMs differentiated from peripheral blood and bone marrow showed similar characteristics and functionality, suggesting that isolating cells from different anatomical niches does not affect macrophage differentiation after CD14 isolation. Consequently, due to high yield and ready availability peripheral blood derived macrophages are still the most suitable source.	ADCP; PBMCs; bone marrow; macrophages; phagocytosis

Arthroscopic-Assisted Lower Trapezius Tendon Transfer for Irreparable Posterosuperior Rotator Cuff Tears Using a Quadricipital Tendon Allograft and a Double-Row Construct.	Lower trapezius transfer is a joint salvage treatment option for irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tears in relatively young patients. It requires the use of a tendinous graft to bridge the gap between the lower trapezius and the greater tuberosity. Inlay fixation of hamstring autografts and onlay single-row fixation of Achilles allografts have been described in the literature. This technical note describes an arthroscopic-assisted lower trapezius transfer using a quadricipital tendon allograft fixed with an onlay knotless double-row construct.

Biphasic Aromatic Amine-Cured Polybutadiene Polyurethane-Ureas for Simultaneous Bonding of Materials with Different Polarities.	In this study, aromatic amine curing agents (A-HD, A-NPG, and A-DCP) were synthesized through the Michael addition of 3-aminobenzylamine with 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, and octahydro-1H-4,7-methanoindene-1,5-diyldimethanediyl bisprop-2-enoate, respectively. The incorporation of these aromatic amine curing agents into low-polarity polybutadiene polyurethane-ureas balanced the polar and dispersion components of surface energy, enhancing the simultaneous bonding performance with materials of different polarities. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the prepared polybutadiene polyurethane-ureas exhibited a significant microphase separation between the soft and hard segments. The polybutadiene soft segments facilitated bonding to low-polarity materials, while the isocyanate and aromatic amine hard segments enabled effective adhesion to polar materials. Moreover, the viscosity and pot life of the polyurethane-urea mixture can be controlled through the modulation of intermediate structures of aromatic amine curing agents. The polyurethane-urea sample PU-DCP achieved the highest shear bonding strength of 4.36 MPa between steel sheets (a polar material) and styrene-butadiene rubber (a low-polarity material). This strength was 39% and 53% higher than those of polybutadiene polyurethane-ureas cured with the commonly used curing agents 4,4'-methylene bis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) and dimethyl thio-toluene diamine (E300). This paper presents a method to achieve effective bonding between low-polarity and polar materials through the modulation of the phase-separated structure in polyurethanes.

Cell-based glycoengineering for production of homogeneous and specific glycoform-enriched antibodies with improved effector functions.	Glycosylation of humanized antibody at Fc-Asn297 significantly affects the Fc-mediated killing of target cells through effector functions, especially antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), and antibody-dependent vaccinal effect (ADVE). Previous studies showed that therapeutic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies with α2,6-sialyl complex type (SCT) glycan attached to Fc-Asn297 exhibited optimal binding to the Fc receptors on effector cells associated with ADCC, ADCP, and ADVE. However, the production of antibodies with homogeneous Fc-SCT glycan requires multiple in vitro enzymatic and purification steps. In this study, we report two cell-based methods to produce Fc-GlcNAc antibody and Fc-SCT-enriched antibodies with improved effector functions. First, we expressed endoglycosidase S2 in Expi293F GnT1- cells to trim all N-glycans to Fc-GlcNAc antibody for in vitro transglycosylation to generate homogeneous antibodies with well-defined Fc glycan. Second, we engineered the glycosylation pathway of HEK293T cells through knock-out of undesired glycosyltransferases and knock-in of desired glycosyltransferases to produce Fc-SCT-enriched antibodies and evaluated their binding to Fc receptors, and we found that the Fc-SCT-enriched antibody is like or better than the homogeneous Fc-SCT antibody in binding to the Fc receptors associated with ADCC, ADCP, and ADVE.

Aberrantly glycosylated Mucin 1 (MUC1) is frequently over-expressed in epithelial cancers, making it an attractive target for cancer vaccines. Over the past two decades, multiple MUC1-based vaccines have been investigated clinically, yet they have generally shown limited efficacy due to challenges such as low immunogenicity, difficulty in overcoming immune tolerance, and potential issues related to glycosylation effects and antigen presentations. To advance the understanding of MUC1 vaccines, we report an efficient chemo-enzymatic approach for the preparation of four MUC1 antigen variants with different glycoforms through liquid-phase glycopeptide synthesis. These antigen were conjugated with CRM197 to generate various glycopeptide-protein conjugate vaccines, and their immunogenicity was evaluated based on total and subtype antibody titers, binding affinity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). The combination of MPL and QS21 adjuvants with STn-MUC1-CRM197 conjugate induced a potent Th1-biased immune response, evidenced by elevating IgG2a titers and stronger antibody binding to MCF-7 cells. This formulation demonstrated superior CDC activity, ADCP activity and binding affinity to human breast cancer tissues in immuno-histochemical assays.

Donor Specific Antibodies (DSAs) are associated with a higher risk of Antibody Mediated Rejection (AMR). However, not all DSAs are pathogenic, and patients that raise DSAs have a wide spectrum of outcomes ranging from the complete absence of graft injury to severe AMR. Hence, characterization of both the qualitative features and titer of DSAs has the potential to predict AMR risk and treatment outcome for sensitized patients. Here, using HLA-A2+ cell-based assays, we investigate the qualitative features of immunoglobulin G (IgG) alloantibodies including Fc receptor binding properties and Fc-mediated effector function over time. Compared to seronegative controls, reactive antibodies in seropositive participants were predominantly IgG1, and exhibited elevated levels of binding to the receptors involved in Antibody Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP) and Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. Further analysis of seropositive individuals revealed that these activities were predictive ofAMR status. Collectively, these results suggest a role for phagocytic and cytotoxic antibody effector functions of DSA in contributing to graft injury.

Serum autoantibody-based biomarkers for prognosis in early-stage lung cancer patients with surgical resection.	Lung cancer is the cancer with the highest morbidity and mortality in the world. With the increasing diagnosis rate of patients with early-stage lung cancer, surgery treatment becomes an option for more patients. However, there is a lack of effective indicators to assess the risk of recurrence after lung cancer surgery. We collected levels of serum autoantibodies and evaluated their roles as biomarkers especially for postoperative recurrence of lung cancer. In vitro experiments including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) were performed to explore the functions of serum autoantibodies. Our study demonstrated that serum autoantibody-positive patients with early-stage lung cancer had a longer postoperative progression period. The levels of serum autoantibodies in patients with lung cancer were higher than that in patients with benign lung diseases. But all the serum autoantibodies had no difference between patients with stage I and II. In addition, the results of in vitro experiments indicated that serum autoantibodies can mediate immune responses and enhance anti-tumour effects. This study proposed effective biomarkers for prognosis in lung cancer patients after surgery which is critical to reduce the recurrence.	Autoantibody; biomarker; lung cancer; prognosis; surgery

Alcohol use profile, motivation to quit, and attitude toward drinking in participants of a community alcohol de-addiction camp and a clinical setting: A comparative study.	Due to a lack of awareness and inadequate health infrastructure, the treatment gap for any mental illness is increasing in lower- and middle-income countries, including India. As an alternative to institutional treatment, community de-addiction camps play an important role. This comparative study examined alcohol use profiles, motivation to quit, and attitudes toward drinking in 84 participants, equally divided between a community alcohol de-addiction camp ( The study found that community-based alcohol de-addiction camp participants were significantly older than the clinical population ( Both groups showed high daily alcohol use and readiness to quit, but alcohol de-addiction camp participants (ADCP) participants had higher eagerness for treatment and lower attitudes toward drinking.

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infects over 95% of the world's population and is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis (IM). Epidemiologic studies have linked EBV with certain cancers or autoimmune conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent studies suggest that molecular mimicry between EBV proteins, particularly EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1), and self-proteins is a plausible mechanism through which EBV infection may contribute to the development of autoimmune disorders. We used a systems immunology approach to investigate the magnitude, specificity, and functional properties of EBNA-1 specific antibodies in a cohort of 97 young adults with IM from presentation through 1-year post-primary infection compared to a control cohort of EBV-seropositive individuals. Levels of EBNA-1 specific IgG1 and IgG3 binding antibodies increased over the course of infection. EBNA-1 antibodies capable of mediating antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD) were detected at or after 6 months. Binding and ADCP- and ADCD-leveraged antibodies primarily targeted a region of EBNA-1 known to elicit cross-reactive antibodies to several self-peptides in individuals with MS. Significantly higher binding and ADCD-active antibodies targeting EBNA-1 were observed in individuals with at least one HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele, a known genetic risk factor for MS; Importantly, high levels of antibodies capable of binding alpha crystalline beta (CRYAB) and mediating complement deposition were detected at 6 months and 1-year following IM; CRYAB antibodies were resistant to denaturing forces, indicating an affinity matured response. Blocking experiments confirmed that CRYAB antibodies were cross-reactive with EBNA-1. Altogether, these results demonstrate that high levels of functional antibodies targeting EBNA-1 are generated in early EBV infection, some of which are cross-reactive with CRYAB. Further investigation is warranted to determine how these antibody responses may contribute to the subsequent development of MS.

Biochemical and biophysical mechanisms macrophages use to tune phagocytic appetite.	Macrophages phagocytose, or eat, pathogens, dead cells and cancer cells. To activate phagocytosis, macrophages recognize 'eat me' signals like IgG and phosphatidylserine on the target cell surface. Macrophages must carefully adjust their phagocytic appetite to ignore non-specific or transient eat me signal exposure on healthy cells while still rapidly recognizing pathogens and debris. Depending on the context, macrophages can increase their appetite for phagocytosis, to prioritize an effective immune response, or decrease their appetite, to avoid damage to healthy tissue during homeostasis. In this Review, we discuss the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms that macrophages employ to increase or decrease their sensitivity or capacity for phagocytosis. We discuss evidence that macrophages tune their sensitivity via several mechanisms, including altering the balance of activating and inhibitory receptor expression, altering the availability of activating receptors, as well as influencing their clustering and mobility, and modulating inhibitory receptor location. We also highlight how membrane availability limits the capacity of macrophages for phagocytosis and discuss potential mechanisms to promote membrane recycling and increase phagocytic capacity. Overall, this Review highlights recent work detailing the molecular toolkit that macrophages use to alter their appetite.	ADCP; Efferocytosis; IgG; Macrophage; Phagocytic Appetite; Phagocytosis

Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory CLL Patients With PI3Kδ Inhibitor and Anti-CD20 Antibody Rapidly Decreases Tumor Burden but Could Induce Resistance.	Multi-drug combination strategy targeting three different molecules involved in different pathways to overcome single-agent resistance in relapsed/refractory CLL patients. The clinical trial utilized 1)a therapeutic anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), ublituximab, which destroys CLL cells by an antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) mechanism; 2)a B cell receptor (BCR) signaling inhibitor, umbralisib, which blocks PI3Kẟ; 3)and an anti-apoptosis inhibitor, venetoclax, which blocks cell survival promoted by BCL-2 that stops mitochondria from initiating apoptosis. Our correlative study focused on the first two treatments prior to venetoclax addition. We found that patients respond to anti-CD20 antibody and BCR signaling inhibition with rapid reductions in CLL cell counts and CD20 levels. Standard high dose (375 mg/m2) anti-CD20 antibody treatment significantly decreased CLL surface CD20 levels, potentially limiting treatment efficacy. Anti-CD20 antibody plus B cell receptor signaling inhibition reduced CLL cell counts and lymph node tumors, enabling BCL-2 inhibitor treatment to avoid tumor lysis syndrome.	immunology; immunotherapy; leukemia; lymphoma; signal transduction therapeutics

Definition of sinonasal and otological exacerbation in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia: an expert consensus.	Recurrent infections of the nose, sinuses and ears are common problems for people with primary ciliary dyskinesia. While pulmonary exacerbations in primary ciliary dyskinesia are defined, there is no definition for ear-nose-throat exacerbations, a potential outcome for research and clinical trials. We set up an expert panel of 24 ear-nose-throat specialists, respiratory physicians, other healthcare professionals and patients to develop consensus definitions of sinonasal and otological exacerbations in children and adults with primary ciliary dyskinesia for research settings. We reviewed the literature and used a modified Delphi approach with four electronic surveys. Definitions for both sinonasal and otological exacerbations are based on a combination of major and minor criteria, requiring three major or two major and at least two minor criteria each. Major criteria for a sinonasal exacerbation are 1) reported acute increase in nasal discharge or change in colour, 2) reported acute pain or sensitivity in the sinus regions and 3) mucopurulent discharge on examination. Minor criteria include reported symptoms, examination signs, doctor's decision to treat and improvement after at least 14 days. Major criteria for the otological exacerbation are 1) reported acute ear pain or sensitivity, 2) reported acute ear discharge, 3) ear discharge on examination and 4) signs of otitis media in otoscopy. Minor criteria are reported acute hearing problems, signs of acute complication, and doctor's decision to treat. These definitions might offer a useful outcome measure for primary ciliary dyskinesia research in different settings. They should be validated in future studies and trials together with other potential outcomes, to assess their usability.

Domestic sewage dispersion scenarios as a subsidy to the design of urban sewage systems in the Lower Amazon River, Amapá, Brazil.	The final in natura discharge of urban domestic sewage in rivers in the Amazon is a widespread practice. In addition, there is an evident lack of knowledge about the self-depurative characteristics of the receiving water bodies in these rivers. This problem is a challenge for designing sanitary sewage system (SSS) projects in the region. We aimed to numerically simulate hydrodynamic scenarios to study pollutant dispersion processes in an urban stretch impacted by domestic sewage in the Lower Amazon River (Amapá, Brazil) using a hydrodynamic model calibrated and coupled to a dispersive model (Lagrangian) (SisBaHiA). The following methodological steps were performed: (a) bathymetric and liquid discharge experimental campaigns using acoustic techniques (acoustic doppler current profiler-ADCP); (b) identification of point and diffuse sources of pollution in the Santana Channel (CSA) and North Channel of the Amazon River (NCM) in Macapá; (c) calibration of the hydrodynamic model and simulation of the dispersive process of domestic sewage plumes; (d) simulation of dispersive process scenarios in two seasonal hydrological periods and different tidal phases. The results of the simulations indicated significant spatiotemporal variations in the plumes, suggesting critical restriction of water quality in the dry period. The hotspot water collection supply station for ETA-CAESA was found to be the most threatened site by diffuse and point source loads. The simulated impacts showed that concentration variation worsens seasonally, restricting the multiple uses of water in both seasonal periods, regardless of tide phase. The pollutant plumes near the coastal-urban zone were apparently more inhibited by the influence of currents, and, due to the greater dilution capacity in the center of the channel, by the effect reversing with the approximation to the riverbank. The research hypotheses were supported: (a) the process of self-depuration of pollutants in the NCM has considerable limitations in shallow areas, and (b) SSS design projects in the region of the Amazon estuarine complex require hydrodynamic and strict water quality assessment, especially when their hydrological-seasonal and bathymetric characteristics are significantly unfavorable to dispersive processes. Thus, a hydrodynamic analysis should be the primary criterion in designing any SSS projects in this stretch of the estuarine Amazon region.

Fc Effector Function of Immune Checkpoint Blocking Antibodies in Oncology.	"Antagonistic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting inhibitory immune checkpoints have revolutionized the field of oncology. CTLA-4, PD-1, and LAG3 are three co-inhibitory receptors, which can be expressed by subsets of T cells and which play a role in the regulation of adaptive immune responses. Blocking these immune checkpoints receptors (or their ligands) with antagonistic antibodies can lead to tumor regressions and lasting remissions in some patients with cancer. Two anti-CTLA4, six anti-PD1, three anti-PD-L1, and one anti-LAG3 antibodies are currently approved by the FDA and EMA. Their mechanism of action, safety, and efficacy are linked to their affinity with Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) (so called ""effector functions""). The anti-CTLA-4 antibodies ipilimumab (IgG1) and tremilimumab (IgG2a), and the anti-PD-L1 avelumab (IgG1) have isotypes with high affinity for activating FcγR and thereby can induce ADCC/ADCP. The effector function is required for the in vivo efficacy of anti-CTLA4 antibodies. For anti-PD(L)1 antibodies, where a pure antagonistic function (""checkpoint blockade"") is sufficient, some mAbs are IgG1 but have been mutated in their Fc sequence (e.g., durvalumab and atezolizumab) or are IgG4 (e.g., nivolumab and pembrolizumab) to have low affinity for FcγR. Here, we review the impact of FcγR effector function on immune checkpoint blockers safety and efficacy in oncology."	FcγR; immune checkpoint; monoclonal antibody

Sialylation inhibition improves macrophage mediated tumor cell phagocytosis of breast cancer cells triggered by therapeutic antibodies of different isotypes.	Tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages is considered a relevant mechanism of action for many therapeutic IgG antibodies. However, tumor cells employ several mechanisms to evade immune recognition, including hypersialylation. Here, we describe how reduction of sialic acid exposure on tumor cells promotes antibody-dependent tumor cell phagocytosis (ADCP) by macrophages. Incubation with the sialyltransferase inhibitor (STi) P-3Fax-Neu5Ac reduced sialylation on two breast cancer cell lines, rendering these cells more susceptible to macrophage mediated phagocytosis by EGFR or HER2 antibodies. This was observed with not only IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies but also IgA2 variants. These results show that inhibiting sialic acid exposure triggers enhanced tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages irrespective of the antibody isotype and the tumor target antigen. Investigating the underlying mechanisms of enhanced ADCP, we observed reduced binding of soluble sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglec)-7 and Siglec-9 to tumor cells after sialylation inhibition. However, Fc silent blocking antibodies against Siglec-7 or Siglec-9, or their combination, only marginally improved ADCP. Our results further promote the concept of cancer hypersialylation as immune escape mechanism, which could serve as target to improve tumor immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies.

Macrophages in the B cell lymphoma microenvironment represent a functional node in progression and therapeutic response. We assessed metabolic regulation of macrophages in the context of therapeutic antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) inhibition induces increased phagocytic lymphoma cell clearance by macrophages in vitro, in primary human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient co-cultures, and in mouse models. Addition of the PPP inhibitor S3 to antibody therapy achieves significantly prolonged overall survival in an aggressive B cell lymphoma mouse model. PPP inhibition induces metabolic activation and pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages while it decreases macrophages' support for survival of lymphoma cells empowering anti-lymphoma function. As a mechanism of macrophage repolarization, the link between PPP and immune regulation was identified. PPP inhibition causes decreased glycogen level and subsequent modulation of the immune modulatory uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG)-Stat1-Irg1-itaconate axis. Thus, we hypothesize the PPP as a key regulator and targetable modulator of macrophage activity in lymphoma to improve efficacy of immunotherapies and prolong survival.

CoronaVac-induced antibodies that facilitate Fc-mediated neutrophil phagocytosis track with COVID-19 disease resolution.	Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants raise concerns about decreased vaccine efficacy, vaccines continue to confer robust protection in humans, implying that immunity beyond neutralization contributes to vaccine efficacy. In addition to neutralization, antibodies can mediate various Fc-dependent effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). However, the specific role of each Fc-mediated effector function in contributing to COVID-19 disease attenuation in human remains unclear. To fully define the potential immune correlates of Fc-mediated effector functions, we comprehensively analysed the above Fc-mediated effector functions in two study cohorts. In the CoronaVac vaccinee cohort, individuals without breakthrough infection exhibited higher levels of ADCP and ADNP activities with a greater degree of cross-reactivity compared to those who had breakthrough infection. A predictive model was established incorporating ADNP activity and IgG titre, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.837. In the COVID-19 patient cohort, BA.5-specific ADCP and ADNP responses were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients with fatal outcomes compared to milder outcomes. The prognostic model incorporating WT, BA.5, and XBB.1.5 spike-specific ADNP demonstrated effective predictive ability, achieving an AUC of 0.890. Meanwhile, transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients in the acute phases of infection highlighted remarkably upregulation of neutrophil activity and phagocytic function, further reinforcing the essential role of ADNP. Collectively, our findings underscored Fc-mediated effector activities, especially neutrophil phagocytosis, as significant antibody biomarkers for the risk of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection and COVID-19 prognosis.

Development and validation of the antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis-based signature: A prognostic risk model of gastric cancer.	Accumulating evidence has supported the effect of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and cancer therapy. However, an ADCP-based signature to predict the prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) has not been established. We aimed to develop an ADCP-based signature to improve the prognosis prediction of GC. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis genes that exhibited a differential expression were characterized, followed by the construction and validation of the ADCP-based signature. The potential association between the ADCP-based signature and TME was explored, and the features of the signature genes were investigated. Finally, a predictive nomogram was established based on the ADCP-based signature. Four ADCP-related genes, MKNK2, VCAN, LRAT, and GNGB, were identified to construct the ADCP-based signature, and a high ADCP score predicted an unfavorable prognosis in GC patients (p < 0.05). The ADCP-based signature was significantly associated with immune cells, immune checkpoints and immune signaling pathways (p < 0.05). Gastric cancer patients with high ADCP scores benefited less from immunotherapy compared to those with low ADCP scores. A nomogram including age, stage and risk score of the ADCP-based signature was constructed to predict the 1-, 3- and 5-year survival probabilities, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.669, 0.675 and 0.685, respectively. The ADCP-based signature may serve as a new option for prognosis prediction and the personalized treatment of GC patients.	antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis; bioinformatics analysis; gastric cancer; prognostic signature; tumor microenvironment

Real-Time and Long-Term Monitoring of Coastal Water Turbidity Using an Ocean Buoy Equipped with an ADCP.	In this study, an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) operating at 600 kHz was installed on an ocean data buoy in the Qigu waters, Taiwan, to gather real-time sound echo intensity data. These data were then correlated with turbidity measurements obtained by a turbidimeter mounted on the buoy's mooring line at a water depth of 13 m. The data buoy operated from 6 June to 16 August 2017. During this period, turbidity measurements were recorded from 6 to 21 June 2017. This study established a calibration between the sound echo intensity measured by the ADCP and the turbidity measured using the turbidimeter; a strong linear correlation was discovered between these two variables. This correlation enabled the conversion of echo intensity data into a continuous time series of turbidity measurements, facilitating real-time and long-term monitoring of coastal water turbidity through the deployment of a buoy equipped with an ADCP. The relationships between turbidity and environmental factors such as rainfall, tides, current speeds, and wave activity over an extended period were then investigated. The results revealed that stronger tides and currents in the Qigu waters often lead to higher turbidity, suggesting that these two factors are the primary driving forces for sediment transport in the Qigu waters. Additionally, sampling of water in the Qigu area revealed sediment particles of size ranging from 2 to 120 μm.

Neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent studies, however, show that binding antibody titers, in the absence of robust neutralizing activity, also correlate with protection against disease progression. Non-neutralizing antibodies cannot directly protect against infection but may recruit effector cells and thus contribute to the clearance of infected cells. Additionally, they often bind conserved epitopes across multiple variants. Here, we characterize 42 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-vaccinated individuals. Most of these antibodies exhibit no neutralizing activity in vitro, but several non-neutralizing antibodies provide protection against lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 in different animal models. A subset of those mAbs shows a clear dependence on Fc-mediated effector functions. We have determined the structures of three non-neutralizing antibodies, with two targeting the receptor-binding domain and one that binds the subdomain 1 region. Our data confirm the real-world observation in humans that non-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can be protective.

Potent broadly neutralizing antibodies mediate efficient antibody-dependent phagocytosis of HIV-infected cells.	Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) has been implicated in protection against HIV-1. However, methods for measuring ADCP currently rely on the phagocytosis of gp120- or gp41-coated beads that do not reflect physiologically relevant conformations of the viral envelope glycoprotein or the size of a virus-infected cell. We therefore developed a novel approach for measuring ADCP of HIV-infected cells expressing natural conformations of Env. A monocytic cell line (THP-1 cells) or primary human monocytes were incubated with a CD4+ T cell line that expresses eGFP upon HIV-1 infection in the presence of antibodies and ADCP was measured as the accumulation of eGFP+ material by flow cytometry. The internalization of HIV-infected cells by monocytes was confirmed visually by image-capture flow cytometry. Cytoskeletal remodeling, pseudopod formation and phagocytosis were also observed by confocal microscopy. We found that potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), but not non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs), mediate efficient phagocytosis of cells infected with either primary or lab-adapted HIV-1. A nnAb to a CD4-inducible epitope of gp120 (A32) failed to enable ADCP of HIV-infected cells but mediated efficient phagocytosis of gp120-coated beads. Conversely, a bnAb specific to intact Env trimers (PGT145) mediated potent ADCP of HIV-infected cells but did not facilitate the uptake of gp120-coated beads. These results underscore the importance of measuring ADCP of HIV-infected cells expressing physiologically relevant conformations of Env and show that most antibodies that are capable of binding to Env trimers on virions to neutralize virus infectivity are also capable of binding to Env on the surface of virus-infected cells to mediate ADCP.

Preventative Cancer Vaccine-Elicited Human Anti-MUC1 Antibodies Have Multiple Effector Functions.	Mucin-1 (MUC1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed and hypoglycosylated in premalignant and malignant epithelial cells compared to normal cells, creating a target antigen for humoral and cellular immunity. Healthy individuals with a history of advanced colonic adenomas and at high risk for colon cancer were enrolled in a clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of using a MUC1 peptide vaccine to prevent colon cancer. Anti-MUC1 antibodies elicited by this vaccine were cloned using peripheral blood B cells and sera collected two weeks after a one-year booster. Twelve of these fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were tested for binding to MUC1+ target cells, and three with the highest binding were further evaluated for various effector functions important for tumor rejection. Immune cells were incubated together with target cells expressing variations in the number, distance, and membrane anchoring properties of the MUC1 epitope in the presence of each mAb. All three mAbs mediated antibody-dependent cytokine release (ADCR), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Two also mediated antibody-dependent trogocytosis/trogoptosis (ADCT). None were capable of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). ADCP and ADCT functions were more efficient when antibodies bound epitopes proximal to and anchored to the membrane, providing insight for future therapeutic antibody validation strategies.

Monoclonal Antibodies for the Treatment of Ocular Diseases.	Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized the landscape of cancer therapy, offering unprecedented specificity and diverse mechanisms to combat malignant cells. These biologic agents have emerged as a cornerstone in targeted cancer treatment, binding to specific antigens on cancer cells and exerting their therapeutic effects through various mechanisms, including inhibition of signaling pathways, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). The unique ability of mAbs to engage the immune system and directly interfere with cancer cell function has significantly enhanced the therapeutic armamentarium against a broad spectrum of malignancies. mAbs were initially studied in oncology; however, today, treatments have been developed for eye diseases. This review discusses the current applications of mAbs for the treatment of ocular diseases, discussing the specificity and the variety of mechanisms by which these molecules exhibit their therapeutic effects. The benefits, drawbacks, effectiveness, and risks associated with using mAbs in ophthalmology are highlighted, focusing on the most relevant ocular diseases and mAbs currently in use. Technological advances have led to in vitro production methods and recombinant engineering techniques, allowing the development of chimeric, humanized, and fully human mAbs. Nowadays, many humanized mAbs have several applications, e.g., for the treatment of age-related macular disease, diabetic retinopathy, and uveitis, while studies about new applications of mAbs, such as for SARS-CoV-2 infection, are also currently ongoing to seek more efficient and safe approaches to treat this new ocular disease.	age-related macular degeneration; diabetic retinopathy; monoclonal antibodies; ocular diseases; uveitis

Atlas of pacific sand lance (Ammodytes personatus) benthic habitat - Application of multibeam acoustics and directed sampling to identify viable subtidal substrates.	Defining and delineating species distribution and habitat is critical to informed management and conservation. This process is complicated in marine environments, where detection of marine taxa and characterization of marine habitat is more difficult. Small pelagic fishes and forage fishes are particularly challenging, though insights may be more accessible in species highly dependent on particular habitat. Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes personatus) is a common and ecologically-important pelagic fish that relies on specific benthic sediments for rest and refuge from predation. We applied multibeam echosounder (MBES) bathymetric data to develop high-definition benthic habitat maps and implemented multiyear sampling to assess potential habitat for sand lance via in situ sampling of sediments. We also applied acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP) data and tidally-driven volume-based ocean models to measure current strength and to visualize currents. We leveraged this data to further define and describe habitat for this important forage species. Sediment transport processes were mapped and areas of dispersal, embedment, and accumulation were evaluated. Dynamic bedform habitats, banner banks and glacial banks were identified as potential habitat and sampled for fish presence, density and sediment composition. In the central Salish Sea, approximately 25% of benthic substrates represent potential sand lance habitat. Sand lance prevalence and density correlated with substrate type and sediment coarseness. Densities were highest in areas of coarse grain sediments and presence was limited by fine particulates, such as silt and mud. Tidal currents appear important. Presence and densities of sand lance were correlated with current velocity and distance from current flow path. Nearly all viable sites were located on the immediate margins of high flow (<0.16 km from tidal currents with max speed of 1.72-2.58 m/s). While both flood and ebb were important, processes related to flood were dominant. Viable habitat was not constrained by depth. These results inform a developing atlas for sand lance in the central Salish Sea, provide new insights to subtidal sand lance habitat, characterize conditions that create and maintain subtidal benthic habitat, and provide a template for mapping habitat for this species in the coastal Pacific Ocean.

Using IMGT unique numbering for IG allotypes and Fc-engineered variants of effector properties and half-life of therapeutic antibodies.	Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are usually of the IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 classes, and their heavy chains may be modified by amino acid (aa) changes involved in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and/or half-life. Allotypes and Fc-engineered variants are classified using IMGT/HGNC gene nomenclature (e.g., Homo sapiens IGHG1). Allotype names follow the WHO/IMGT nomenclature. IMGT-engineered variant names use the IMGT nomenclature (e.g., Homsap G1v1), which comprises species and gene name (both abbreviated) followed by the letter v (for variant) and a number. Both allotypes and engineered variants are defined by their aa changes and positions, based on the IMGT unique numbering for C domain, identified in sequence motifs, referred to as IMGT topological motifs, as their limits and length are standardized and correspond to a structural feature (e.g., strand or loop). One hundred twenty-six variants are displayed with their type, IMGT numbering, Eu-IMGT positions, motifs before and after changes, and their property and function (effector and half-life). Three motifs characterize effector variants, CH2 1.6-3, 23-BC-41, and the FG loop, whereas three different motifs characterize half-life variants, two on CH2 13-AB-18 and 89-96 with H93, and one on CH3 the FG loop with H115.

Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy, particularly the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors, have reignited interest in targeted monoclonal antibodies for immunotherapy. Antibody therapies aim to minimize on-target, off-tumor toxicity by targeting antigens overexpressed on tumor cells but not on healthy cells. Despite considerable efforts, some therapeutic antibodies have been linked to dose-limiting side effects. Our hypothesis suggests that the efficacy of IgG leads to a lower target expression threshold for tumor cell killing, contributing to these side effects. Earlier, therapeutic IgG antibodies were reformatted into the IgA isotype. Unlike IgG, which primarily engages Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by NK cells and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) by monocytes/macrophages, IgA antibodies activate neutrophils through the Fc alpha receptor I (CD89, FcαRI). In previous studies, it appeared that IgA may require a higher target expression threshold for effective killing, and we aimed to investigate this in our current study. Moreover, we investigated how blocking the myeloid checkpoint CD47/SIRPα axis affect the target expression threshold. Using a tetracycline-inducible expression system, we regulated target expression in different cell lines. Our findings from ADCC assays indicate that IgA-mediated PMN ADCC requires a higher antigen expression level than IgG-mediated PBMC ADCC. Furthermore, blocking CD47 enhanced IgA-mediated ADCC, lowering the antigen threshold. Validated in two in vivo models, our results show that IgA significantly reduces tumor growth in high-antigen-expressing tumors without affecting low-antigen-expressing healthy tissues. This suggests IgA-based immunotherapy could potentially minimize on-target, off-tumor side effects, improving treatment efficacy and patient safety.

It is forced by tides, wind, non-tidal sea level variability as well as salinity and temperature through a nudging scheme. The model was calibrated against existing data from previous fixed location instrument deployments and hull mounted ADCP data. While the model has limitations, it performs well against measured data and provides a useful tool for describing spatially varying currents throughout East Victorian waters.	3 dimensional; Biophysical connectivity; Multi-resolution; Numerical modelling

Substantial reduction of the intact proviral reservoir is essential towards HIV-1 cure. In vivo administration of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer can decrease the viral reservoir, through Fc-mediated killing of infected cells. In this study, we compared three commonly used antibody engineering strategies to enhance Fc-mediated effector functions: (i) glyco-engineering, (ii) protein engineering, and (iii) subclass/hinge modifications in a panel of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. We found that antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) was improved by elongating the hinge domain and switching to an IgG3 constant domain. In addition, potent NK cell activation and ADCC activity was observed for afucosylated antibodies and antibodies bearing the GASDALIE mutations. The combination of these engineering strategies further increased NK cell activation and induced antibody dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) of infected cells at low antibody concentrations. The bNAb N6 was most effective at killing HIV-1 infected cells, likely due to its high affinity and optimal angle of approach. Overall, the findings of this study are applicable to other antibody formats, and can aid the development of effective immunotherapies and antibody-based treatments for HIV-1 cure strategies.

The continued emergence of deadly human coronaviruses from animal reservoirs highlights the need for pan-coronavirus interventions for effective pandemic preparedness. Here, using linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing (LIBRA-seq), we report a panel of 50 coronavirus antibodies isolated from human B cells. Of these, 54043-5 was shown to bind the S2 subunit of spike proteins from alpha-, beta-, and deltacoronaviruses. A cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of 54043-5 bound to the prefusion S2 subunit of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike defined an epitope at the apex of S2 that is highly conserved among betacoronaviruses. Although non-neutralizing, 54043-5 induced Fc-dependent antiviral responses in vitro, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). In murine SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies, protection against disease was observed after introduction of Leu234Ala, Leu235Ala, and Pro329Gly (LALA-PG) substitutions in the Fc region of 54043-5. Together, these data provide new insights into the protective mechanisms of non-neutralizing antibodies and define a broadly conserved epitope within the S2 subunit.

Enhancing Fc-mediated effector functions of monoclonal antibodies: The example of HexaBodies.	"Since the approval of the CD20-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab for the treatment of lymphoma in 1997, mAb therapy has significantly transformed cancer treatment. With over 90 FDA-approved mAbs for the treatment of various hematological and solid cancers, modern cancer treatment relies heavily on these therapies. The overwhelming success of mAbs as cancer therapeutics is attributed to their broad applicability, high safety profile, and precise targeting of cancer-associated surface antigens. Furthermore, mAbs can induce various anti-tumor cytotoxic effector mechanisms including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), all of which are mediated via their fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain. Over the past decades, these effector mechanisms have been substantially improved through Fc domain engineering. In this review, we will outline the different approaches to enhance Fc effector functions via Fc engineering of mAbs, with a specific emphasis on the so-called ""HexaBody"" technology, which is designed to enhance the hexamerization of mAbs on the target cell surface, thereby inducing greater complement activation, CDC, and receptor clustering. The review will summarize the development, preclinical, and clinical testing of several HexaBodies designed for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, as well as the potential use of the HexaBody technology beyond Fc-mediated effector functions."

Compartment-specific antibody correlates of protection to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron in macaques.	Antibodies represent a primary mediator of protection against respiratory viruses. Serum neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are often considered a primary correlate of protection. However, detailed antibody profiles including characterization of antibody functions in different anatomic compartments are poorly understood. Here we show that antibody correlates of protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) challenge are different in systemic versus mucosal compartments in rhesus macaques. In serum, NAbs were the strongest correlate of protection and linked to spike-specific binding antibodies and other extra-NAb functions that create a larger protective network. In bronchiolar lavage (BAL), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) proved the strongest correlate of protection rather than NAbs. Within BAL, ADCP was linked to mucosal spike-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA/secretory IgA, and Fcγ-receptor binding antibodies. Our results support a model in which antibodies with different functions mediate protection at different anatomic sites.	Biological sciences; Health sciences

Two radiologists scored images for quality on a 4-point scale (image resolution, degree of geometric distortion, lesion selectivity, and diagnostic reliability) and measured signal intensity (SI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). DE and SD groups also united to form the benign group. In all groups, rs-EPI performed better than ss-EPI in image quality, SNR, and CNR (p < 0.05). The difference between mean pathological ADC (ADC The rs-EPI is a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) method with higher image quality that diminishes motion-induced phase errors and increases resolution through phase corrections.

Radiotelemetry reveals the dependence of inland tern breeding and foraging habitats on ADCP-identified sediment aggradation reaches in lowland rivers.	The largest rivers in developed countries have usually been turned into waterways by straightening them and removing large bedforms hampering navigation. For river restoration and their sustainable management it is important to know how large bedforms support biodiversity, whether they could be protected and what potential conflicts in river management they can pose. We have addressed these questions by studying the role of large bedforms in supporting populations of two inland tern species Sternula albifrons and Sterna hirundo. We spatially analysed the behaviour of these two species with reference to the bedform structure mapped over a long semi-natural reach of the River Wisła (Vistula) (S. Poland). The results show that radiotagged terns breed on islands within the aggradation reaches, foraging in the adjacent shallows inhabited by populations of small fish. For Little Terns, the more complex the water line of emergent forms, the greater their foraging intensity. The islands do not pose any flood risk to human settlements. The whole geofeature forms an integral habitat for fish and birds; it is maintained by its geographic settings and so is stable over long periods of time (over 200 years). Protection of such habitats is thus feasible.

Two-sample univariable Mendelian randomization (UVMR), multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR), and mediation analysis were employed to assess the causal relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and pancreatic cancer (PC), as well as potential IC and IM mediators. The two-sample UVMR analysis showed causal relationships between 20 gut microbiota species and pancreatic cancer, with pancreatic cancer affecting the abundance of 37 gut microbiota species. Mediation analysis revealed that Interleukin-6 (IL-6), ""CD4 on naive CD4+ T cell"" and ""SSC-A on HLA DR+ Natural Killer"" mediated the causal effects of gut microbiota on pancreatic cancer. This Mendelian randomization study demonstrates causal relationships between several specific gut microbiota and pancreatic cancer, as well as potential mediators (IC, IM)."

Primary SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adults results in similar Fc-mediated antibody effector function patterns.	Increasing evidence suggests that Fc-mediated antibody effector functions have an important role in protection against respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. However, limited data are available on the potential differences in the development, heterogeneity and durability of these responses in children compared to adults. Here, we assessed the development of spike S1-specific serum antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement deposition (ADCD) and natural killer cell activation (ADNKA), alongside specific antibody binding concentrations (IgG, IgA and IgM) and IgG avidity in healthy adults ( We found similar (functional) antibody responses in children compared to adults, with a tendency for increased durability in children, which was statistically significant for ADCD ( In conclusion, our data provide novel insights into the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody Fc-mediated effector functions in children and adults. An increased understanding of these characteristics in specific age populations is valuable for the future design of novel and improved vaccination strategies for respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.

On the Performance of a Horizontally Mounted ADCP in an Energetic Tidal Environment for Floating Tidal Turbine Applications.	Incident flow measurement is key in the tidal industry for conducting power performance assessments. This paper explores the use of a horizontally mounted Nortek Signature 500 Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) as a means for incident flow measurement onboard a utility-scale tidal turbine. This study shows that the measurement range of an ADCP mounted horizontally in highly dynamic tidal flow (up to 4 m/s) is less than the maximum range stated by the manufacturer. The ability for the horizontal ADCP to accurately resolve velocities in a multi-beam configuration is also analysed. Effects from both vertical shear and beam selection result in incident flow velocities that differ from a single horizontal beam recording. The maximum measurement range of the instrument is found to depend on current speed and on the proportion of data loss that is acceptable to the user. The ability of the ADCP to record data from the free-stream velocity two equivalent diameters upstream of the O2, as set out by IEC TS 62600-200, is considered. It is found that at this distance, there is 90% data loss. Accepting only 10% data loss across all flow speeds resulted in a maximum range of 31 m for a Nortek Signature 500 in this study. While some limitations of an ADCP deployed horizontally in highly energetic tidal flow are identified, the benefits of mounting the sensor close to the rotor facing horizontally into the incoming flow mean that valuable data are still produced for tidal turbine operators.

Recent studies show an important role for non-neutralizing anti-spike antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), in robustly protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These mAbs use Fc-mediated functions such as complement activation, phagocytosis, and cellular cytotoxicity. There is an untapped potential for using non-neutralizing mAbs in durable antibody treatments; because of their available conserved epitopes, they may not be as sensitive to virus mutations as neutralizing mAbs. Here, we discuss evidence of non-neutralizing mAb-mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We explore how non-neutralizing mAb Fc-mediated functions can be enhanced via novel antibody-engineering techniques. Important questions remain to be answered regarding the characteristics of protective non-neutralizing mAbs, including the models and assays used for study, the risks of ensuing detrimental inflammation, as well as the durability and mechanisms of protection.

Specific long-term changes in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG modifications and antibody functions in mRNA, adenovector, and protein subunit vaccines.	Various vaccine platforms were developed and deployed against the COVID-19 disease. The Fc-mediated functions of IgG antibodies are essential in the adaptive immune response elicited by vaccines. However, the long-term changes of protein subunit vaccines and their combinations with messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are unknown. A total of 272 serum and plasma samples were collected from individuals who received first to third doses of the protein subunit Medigen, the mRNA (BNT, Moderna), or the adenovector AstraZeneca vaccines. The IgG subclass level was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Fc-N glycosylation was measured using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Antibody-dependent-cellular-phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement deposition (ADCD) of anti-spike (S) IgG antibodies were measured by flow cytometry. IgG1 and 3 reached the highest anti-S IgG subclass level. IgG1, 2, and 4 subclass levels significantly increased in mRNA- and Medigen-vaccinated individuals. Fc-glycosylation was stable, except in female BNT vaccinees, who showed increased bisection and decreased galactosylation. Female BNT vaccinees had a higher anti-S IgG titer than that of males. ADCP declined in all groups. ADCD was significantly lower in AstraZeneca-vaccinated individuals. Each vaccine produced specific long-term changes in Fc structure and function. This finding is critical when selecting a vaccine platform or combination to achieve the desired immune response.

Antimicrobial peptides have gradually gained advantages over small molecule inhibitors for their multifunctional effects, synthesising accessibility and target specificity. The current study aims to determine an antimicrobial peptide to inhibit PknB, a serine/threonine protein kinase (STPK), by binding efficiently at the helically oriented hinge region. A library of 5626 antimicrobial peptides from publicly available repositories has been prepared and categorised based on the length. Molecular docking using ADCP helped to find the multiple conformations of the subjected peptides. For each peptide served as input the tool outputs 100 poses of the subjected peptide. To maintain an efficient binding for relatively a longer duration, only those peptides were chosen which were seen to bind constantly to the active site of the receptor protein over all the poses observed. Each peptide had different number of constituent amino acid residues; the peptides were classified based on the length into five groups. In each group the peptide length incremented upto four residues from the initial length form. Five peptides were selected for Molecular Dynamic simulation in Gromacs based on higher binding affinity. Post-dynamic analysis and the frame comparison inferred that neither the shorter nor the longer peptide but an intermediate length of 15 mer peptide bound well to the receptor. Residual substitution to the selected peptides was performed to enhance the targeted interaction. The new complexes considered were further analysed using the Elastic Network Model (ENM) for the functional site's intrinsic dynamic movement to estimate the new peptide's role. The study sheds light on prospects that besides the length of peptides, the combination of constituent residues equally plays a pivotal role in peptide-based inhibitor generation. The study envisages the challenges of fine-tuned peptide recovery and the scope of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithm development. As the study was primarily meant for generation of therapeutics for Tuberculosis (TB), the peptide proposed by this study demands meticulous invitro analysis prior to clinical applications.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive and fatal cancer. The prognosis is very poor and no optimal chemotherapy has been established. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, neu, and erbB2) is highly-expressed in breast cancer and is expressed in many other tumors but poorly expressed in CCA. The anti-HER2 antibody, trastuzumab, has been used for the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer. In this study, we examined the surface expression of HER2 on seven Thai liver-fluke-associated CCA cell lines by flow cytometry, and found all of these CCA cells were weakly positive for HER2. MTT assay revealed that trastuzumab directly suppressed the growth of CCA. By using FcR-bearing recombinant Jurkat T-cell-expressing firefly luciferase gene under the control of NFAT response elements, we defined the activities of antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP). ADCC was confirmed by using expanded NK cells. ADCP was confirmed by using mouse peritoneal macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages as effector cells. Rabbit serum was administered to test the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity of trastuzumab. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of trastuzumab in in vivo patient-derived cell xenograft and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Our results showed that a distinct population of CCA (liver-fluke-associated CCA) expressed HER2. Trastuzumab demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect on even HER2 weakly positive CCA both in vitro and in vivo via multiple mechanisms. Thus, HER2 is a promising target in anti-CCA therapy, and trastuzumab can be considered a promising antibody immunotherapy agent for the treatment of CCA.

CD47-SIRPα Blockade Sensitizes Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma to Cetuximab by Enhancing Macrophage Adhesion to Cancer Cells.	Developing effective treatments for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a significant challenge. Cetuximab, a first-line targeted therapy for HNSCC, exhibits limited efficacy. Here, we used pooled CRISPR screening to find targets that can synergize with cetuximab and identified CD47 as the leading candidate. Rather than inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, CD47 inhibition promoted cetuximab-triggered antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), thereby enhancing macrophage-mediated cancer cell removal. The combination of CD47-signal-regulatory protein α (SIRPα) blockade and cetuximab demonstrated strong anticancer activity in vivo. In addition to blocking the phagocytosis checkpoint, CD47-SIRPα inhibition upregulated CD11b/CD18 on the surface of macrophages, which accelerated intercellular adhesion between macrophages and cancer cells to enhance subsequent phagocytosis. Inhibition of the interaction between macrophage CD11b/CD18 and cancer cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) eliminated the intercellular adhesion and phagocytosis induced by CD47-SIRPα blockade. Thus, CD47-SIRPα blockade enhances ADCP through CD11b/CD18-ICAM1-mediated intercellular adhesion and sensitizes HNSCC to cetuximab. Significance: CD47-SIRPα blockade increases surface CD11b/CD18 on macrophages to enhance adhesion to cancer cells, resulting in robust synergistic phagocytosis in combination with cetuximab treatment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Enhancing Neutrophil Cytotoxicity of a Panel of Clinical EGFR Antibodies by Fc Engineering to IgA3.0.	EGFR plays an essential role in cellular signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation, and survival and is often dysregulated in cancer. Several monoclonal IgG antibodies have been clinically tested over the years, which exert their function via blocking the ligand binding domain (thereby inhibiting downstream signaling) and inducing Fc-related effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). However, these IgG antibodies do not optimally recruit neutrophils, which are the most abundant white blood cell population in humans. Therefore, we reformatted six therapeutic EGFR antibodies (cetuximab, panitumumab, nimotuzumab, necitumumab, zalutumumab, and matuzumab) into the IgA3.0 format, which is an IgA2 isotype adapted for clinical application. Reformatting these antibodies preserved Fab-mediated functions such as EGFR binding, growth inhibition, and ligand blockade. In addition, whole leukocyte ADCC was significantly increased when using this panel of IgA3.0 antibodies compared with their respective IgG counterparts, with no major differences between IgA3.0 antibodies. In vivo, IgA3.0 matuzumab outperformed the other antibodies, resulting in the strongest suppression of tumor outgrowth in a long intraperitoneal model. We showed that neutrophils are important for the suppression of tumor outgrowth. IgA3.0 matuzumab exhibited reduced receptor internalization compared with the other antibodies, possibly accounting for its superior in vivo Fc-mediated tumor cell killing efficacy. In conclusion, reformatting EGFR antibodies into an IgA3.0 format increased Fc-mediated killing while retaining Fab-mediated functions and could therefore be a good alternative for the currently available antibody therapies.

Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) is a cellular process by which antibody-opsonized targets (pathogens or cells) activate the Fc receptors on the surface of phagocytes to induce phagocytosis, resulting in internalization and degradation of pathogens or target cells through phagosome acidification. Besides NK cells-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), tumor-infiltrated monocytes and macrophages can directly kill tumor cells in the presence of tumor antigen-specific antibodies through ADCP, representing another attractive strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Even though several methods have been developed to measure ADCP, an automated and high-throughput quantitative assay should offer highly desirable advantages for drug discovery. In this study we established a new ADCP assay to identify therapeutical monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that facilitate macrophages phagocytosis of live target cells. We used Incucyte, an imaging system for live cell analysis. By labeling the live target cells with a pH sensitive dye (pHrodo), we successfully monitored the ADCP in real time. We demonstrated that our image-based assay is robust and quantitative, suitable for screening and characterization of therapeutical mAbs that directly kill target cells through ADCP. Furthermore, we found different subtypes of macrophages have distinct ADCP activities using both mouse and human primary macrophages differentiated in vitro. By studying various mAbs with mutations in their Fc regions using our assay, we showed that the variants with increased binding to Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) have enhanced ADCP activities.

Blockade of the CD47/SIRPα checkpoint axis potentiates the macrophage-mediated antitumor efficacy of tafasitamab.	Macrophages are one of the key mediators of the therapeutic effects exerted by monoclonal antibodies, such as the anti-CD19 antibody tafasitamab, approved in combination with lenalidomide for the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) in the tumor microenvironment can be counteracted by increased expression of the inhibitory receptor SIRPα on macrophages and its ligand, the immune checkpoint molecule CD47, on tumor cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the CD47-SIRPα axis on tafasitamab- mediated phagocytosis and explore the potential of anti-CD47 blockade to enhance its antitumor activity. Elevated expression of both SIRPα and CD47 was observed in DLBCL patient-derived lymph node biopsies compared to healthy control lymph nodes. CRISPR-mediated CD47 overexpression affected tafasitamab-mediated ADCP in vitro and increased expression of SIRPα on macrophages correlated with decreased ADCP activity of tafasitamab against DLBCL cell lines. A combination of tafasitamab and an anti-CD47 blocking antibody enhanced ADCP activity of in vitro-generated macrophages. Importantly, tafasitamab-mediated phagocytosis was elevated in combination with CD47 blockade using primary DLBCL cells and patient-derived lymphoma-associated macrophages in an autologous setting. Furthermore, lymphoma cells with low CD19 expression were efficiently eliminated by the combination treatment. Finally, combined treatment of tafasitamab and an anti-CD47 antibody resulted in enhanced tumor volume reduction and survival benefit in lymphoma xenograft mouse models. These findings provide evidence that CD47 blockade can enhance the phagocytic potential of tumor-targeting immunotherapies such as tafasitamab and suggest that there is value in exploring the combination in the clinic.

Selective depletion of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells with BAY 3375968, a novel Fc-optimized anti-CCR8 antibody.	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are known to facilitate tumor progression by suppressing CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby also hampering the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). While systemic depletion of Tregs can enhance antitumor immunity, it also triggers undesirable autoimmune responses. Therefore, there is a need for therapeutic agents that selectively target Tregs within the TME without affecting systemic Tregs. In this study, as shown also by others, the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 8 (CCR8) was found to be predominantly expressed on Tregs within the TME of both humans and mice, representing a unique target for selective depletion of tumor-residing Tregs. Based on this, we developed BAY 3375968, a novel anti-human CCR8 antibody, along with respective surrogate anti-mouse CCR8 antibodies, and demonstrated their in vitro mode-of-action through induction of potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP) activities. In vivo, anti-mouse CCR8 antibodies effectively depleted Tregs within the TME primarily via ADCP, leading to increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and subsequent tumor growth inhibition across various cancer models. This monotherapeutic efficacy was significantly enhanced in combination with ICIs. Collectively, these findings suggest that CCR8 targeting represents a promising strategy for Treg depletion in cancer therapies. BAY 3375968 is currently under investigation in a Phase I clinical trial (NCT05537740).	Cancer immunotherapy; Chemokine receptor 8; Immunosuppression; Monoclonal antibody; Regulatory T cells

Mosaic vaccine-induced antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis associated with delayed HIV-1 viral load rebound post treatment interruption.	A heterologous Ad26/MVA vaccine was given prior to an analytic treatment interruption (ATI) in people living with HIV-1 (mainly CRF01_AE) who initiated antiretroviral treatment (ART) during acute HIV-1. We investigate the impact of Ad26/MVA vaccination on antibody (Ab)-mediated immune responses and their effect on time to viral rebound. The vaccine mainly triggers vaccine-matched binding Abs while, upon viral rebound post ATI, infection-specific CRF01_AE binding Abs increase in all participants. Binding Abs are not associated with time to viral rebound. The Ad26/MVA mosaic vaccine profile consists of correlated non-CRF01_AE binding Ab and Fc effector features, with strong Ab-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) responses. CRF01_AE-specific ADCP responses (measured either prior to or post ATI) are significantly higher in individuals with delayed viral rebound. Our results suggest that vaccines eliciting cross-reactive responses with circulating viruses in a target population could be beneficial and that ADCP responses may play a role in viral control post treatment interruption.

Reversible Chemical Modification of Antibody Effector Function Mitigates Unwanted Systemic Immune Activation.	Antibody effector functions including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP) are mediated through the interaction of the antibody Fc region with Fcγ receptors present on immune cells. Several approaches have been used to modulate antibody Fc-Fcγ interactions with the goal of driving an effective antitumor immune response, including Fc point mutations and glycan modifications. However, robust antibody-Fcγ engagement and immune cell binding of Fc-enhanced antibodies in the periphery can lead to the unwanted induction of systemic cytokine release and other dose-limiting infusion-related reactions. Creating a balance between effective engagement of Fcγ receptors that can induce antitumor activity without incurring systemic immune activation is an ongoing challenge in the field of antibody and immuno-oncology therapeutics. Herein, we describe a method for the reversible chemical modulation of antibody-Fcγ interactions using simple poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) linkers conjugated to antibody interchain disulfides with maleimide attachments. This method enables dosing of a therapeutic with muted Fcγ engagement that is restored in vivo in a time-dependent manner. The technology was applied to an effector function enhanced agonist CD40 antibody, SEA-CD40, and experiments demonstrate significant reductions in Fc-induced immune activation in vitro and in mice and nonhuman primates despite showing retained efficacy and improved pharmacokinetics compared to the parent antibody. We foresee that this simple, modular system can be rapidly applied to antibodies that suffer from systemic immune activation due to peripheral FcγR binding immediately upon infusion.

Constructing immune and prognostic features associated with ADCP in hepatocellular carcinoma and pan-cancer based on scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq.	Despite the significant therapeutic outcomes achieved in systemic treatments for liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), it is an objective reality that only a low proportion of patients exhibit an improved objective response rate (ORR) to current immunotherapies. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) immunotherapy is considered the new engine for precision immunotherapy. Based on this, we aim to develop an ADCP-based LIHC risk stratification system and screen for relevant targets. Utilizing a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq data, we screened for ADCP modulating factors in LIHC and identified differentially expressed genes along with their involved functional pathways. A risk scoring model was established by identifying ADCP-related genes with prognostic value through LASSO Cox regression analysis. The risk scoring model was then subjected to evaluations of immune infiltration and immunotherapy relevance, with pan-cancer analysis and Building on the research by Kamber RA et al., we identified GYPA, CLDN18, and IRX5 as potential key target genes regulating ADCP in LIHC. These genes demonstrated significant correlations with immune infiltration cells, such as M1-type macrophages, and the effectiveness of immunotherapy in LIHC, as well as a close association with clinical pathological staging and patient prognosis. Pan-cancer analysis revealed that CLDN18 was prognostically and immunologically relevant across multiple types of cancer. Validation through tissue and cell samples confirmed that GYPA and CLDN18 were upregulated in liver cancer tissues and cells. Furthermore, We have identified an ADCP signature in LIHC comprising three genes. Analysis based on a risk scoring model derived from these three genes, coupled with subsequent experimental validation, confirmed the pivotal role of M1-type macrophages in ADCP within LIHC, establishing CLDN18 as a critical ADCP regulatory target in LIHC.	antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis; hepatocellular carcinoma; immunity; pan-cancer; prognosis

Hemagglutinin Stalk-Specific Fc-Mediated Functions Are Associated With Protection Against Influenza Illness After Seasonal Influenza Vaccination.	Future vaccine candidates aim to elicit antibodies against the conserved hemagglutinin stalk domain. Understanding the protective mechanism of these antibodies, which mediate broad neutralization and Fc-mediated functions, following seasonal vaccination is critical. Plasma samples were obtained from pregnant women with or without HIV-1 enrolled in a randomised trial (138 trivalent inactivated vaccine [TIV] and 145 placebo recipients). Twenty-three influenza cases were confirmed within 6 months postpartum. We measured H1 stalk-specific antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement deposition (ADCD) and cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) at enrolment and 1-month postvaccination. Lower H1 stalk-specific ADCP and ADCD activity was detected for participants with confirmed influenza compared with individuals without illness 1-month postvaccination. Pre-existing ADCP scores ≥250 reduced the odds of A/H1N1 infection (odds ratio [OR], 0.11; P = .01) with an 83% likelihood of risk reduction. Following TIV, ADCD scores of ≥25 and ≥15 significantly reduced the odds against A/H1N1 (OR, 0.10; P = .01) and non-group 1 (OR, 0.06; P = .0004) influenza virus infections, respectively. These ADCD scores were associated with >84% likelihood of risk reduction. Overall, H1 stalk-specific Fc effector function correlates with protection against influenza illness following influenza vaccination during pregnancy. These findings provide insight into the protective mechanisms of hemagglutinin stalk antibodies. NCT01306669 and NCT01306682 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Druggability properties of a L309K mutation in the antibody CH2 domain.	In the early stages of antibody drug development, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive assessment and enhancement of the druggability attributes of potential molecules by considering their fundamental physicochemical properties. This study specifically concentrates on the surface-exposed hydrophobic region of the candidate antibody aPDL1-WT and explores the effectiveness of the L309K mutation strategy. The resulting aPDL1-LK variant demonstrates a notable enhancement over the original antibody in addressing the issue of aggregation and formation of large molecular impurities under accelerated high-temperature conditions. The mutated molecule, aPDL1-LK, exhibits excellent physicochemical properties such as hydrophilicity, conformational stability, charge variant stability, post-translational modifications, and serum stability. In terms of biological function, aPDL1-LK maintains the same glycosylation pattern as the original antibody and shows no significant difference in affinity for antigen hPDL1 protein, CD16a-F158, CD64, CD32a-H131, and complement C1q, compared to aPDL1-WT. The L309K mutation results in an approximately twofold reduction in its affinity for CD16a-V158 and CD32a-R131. In vitro biological assays, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), reveal that the L309K mutation may decrease CD16a-V158-mediated ADCC activity due to the mutation-induced decrease in ligand affinity, while not affect CD32a-R131-mediated ADCP activity. In conclusion, the L309K mutation offers a promising strategy to enhance the druggability properties of candidate antibodies.

Thyroid Hormone Receptor Agonistic and Antagonistic Activity of Newly Synthesized Dihydroxylated Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers: An In Vitro and In Silico Coactivator Recruitment Study.	Dihydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (DiOH-PBDEs) could be the metabolites of PBDEs of some organisms or the natural products of certain marine bacteria and algae. OH-PBDEs may demonstrate binding affinity to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and can disrupt the functioning of the systems modulated by TRs. However, the thyroid hormone disruption mechanism of diOH-PBDEs remains elusive due to the absence of diOH-PBDEs standards. This investigation explores the potential disruptive effects of OH/diOH-PBDEs on thyroid hormones via competitive binding and coactivator recruitment with TRα and TRβ. At levels of 5000 nM and 25,000 nM, 6-OH-BDE-47 demonstrated significant recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator (SRC), whereas none of the diOH-PBDEs exhibited SRC recruitment within the range of 0.32-25,000 nM. AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP) simulations suggest that the conformation of SRC and TR-ligand complexes, particularly their interaction with Helix 12, rather than binding affinity, plays a pivotal role in ligand agonistic activity. 6,6'-diOH-BDE-47 displayed antagonistic activity towards both TRα and TRβ, while the antagonism of 3,5-diOH-BDE-100 for TRα and TRβ was concentration-dependent. 3,5-diOH-BDE-17 and 3,5-diOH-BDE-51 exhibited no discernible agonistic or antagonistic activities. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the binding energy of 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) surpassed that of OH/diOH-PBDEs. 3,5-diOH-BDE-100 exhibited the highest binding energy, whereas 6,6'-diOH-BDE-47 displayed the lowest. These findings suggest that the structural determinants influencing the agonistic and antagonistic activities of halogen phenols may be more intricate than previously proposed, involving factors beyond high-brominated PBDEs or hydroxyl group and bromine substitutions. It is likely that the agonistic or antagonistic propensities of OH/diOH-PBDEs are instigated by protein conformational changes rather than considerations of binding energy.

Anti-S IgG concentrations, ADCP scores and ACE2 inhibiting antibody concentrations were highest at one-month post-second dose and declined by four-months post-second dose for all groups. mRNA/mRNA and ChAdOx1-S/mRNA schedules had significantly higher antibody responses than ChAdOx1-S/ChAdOx1-S.

Evaluating climate change impacts on reef environments via multibeam echosounder and Acoustic Doppler Current profiler technology.	Crucial to the Earth's oceans, ocean currents dynamically react to various factors, including rotation, wind patterns, temperature fluctuations, alterations in salinity and the gravitational pull of the moon. Climate change impacts coastal ecosystems, emphasizing the need for understanding these currents. This study explores multibeam echosounder (MBES), specifically R2-Sonic 2020 instrument, offering detailed seabed information. Investigating coral reefs, rocky reefs and artificial reefs aimed to map seafloor currents movement and their climate change responses. MBES data viz. Bathymetry and backscatter were classified and acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) ground data were validated using random forest regression. Results indicated high precision in currents speed measurement i.e. coral reefs with 0.96, artificial reefs with 0.94 and rocky reefs with 0.97. Currents direction accuracy was notable in coral reefs with 0.85, slightly lower in rocky reefs with 0.72 and artificial reefs with 0.60. Random forest identified sediment and backscatter as key for speed prediction while direction relies on bathymetry, slope and aspect. The study emphasizes integrating sediment size, backscatter, bathymetry and ADCP data for seafloor current analysis. This multibeam data on sediments and currents support better marine spatial planning and determine biodiversity patterns planning in the reef area.

Impact of bathymetry on Indian Ocean circulation in a nested regional ocean model.	The Regional Indian Ocean model based on Modular Ocean Model (MOM4p1) was used to understand the importance of a realistic representation of bathymetry on Ocean General Circulation. The model has 1/4° uniform horizontal resolution and is forced with Coordinated Ocean-Ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II) inter-annual forcing with two simulations named BLND (realistic bathymetry) and OM3 (smoothed bathymetry), which only differ in the representation of bathymetry for the years 1992-2005. We also used recent reanalysis products from ORAS5 and SODA3 and ADCP observation to compare the subsurface currents. We show that by the inclusion of realistic bathymetry, there is a significant improvement in the upper ocean salinity, temperature, and currents, particularly near the coast. The salinity and temperature of the upper ocean are very close to the observed value near the coast. The bias in the salinity and temperature was reduced to half in BLND simulation compared to OM3, which led to a more realistic East India Coastal Current (EICC). We show the first evidence of a basin-wide cyclonic gyre over the Bay of Bengal at 1000 m depth during spring, which is just opposite to that of a basin-wide anti-cyclonic gyre at the surface. We found the presence of poleward EICC during spring at 1000 m and 2000 m depth, which is opposite to that of the surface. The presence of this deeper EICC structure is completely absent during fall. We show the presence of a boundary current along the coast of Andaman and Nicobar Island at a depth of 2000 m. The observed Wyrtki Jet (WJ) magnitude and spatial structure are most realistically reproduced in BLND simulation as compared to OM3 simulations. Both ORAS5 and SODA reanalysis products underestimate the WJ magnitude. The presence of the Maldives Islands is responsible for the westward extent of Equatorial Under Current (EUC). The presence of Maldives also creates wakes on the leeward side in the EUC zonal current. During fall, EUC is better defined in the eastern Equatorial Indian Ocean and lies at a depth of between 50 and 100 m, unlike its spring counterpart, in which its core is located slightly deeper, between 100 and 150 m depth. During peak summer months, June-July, a strong eastward zonal jet is present at 1000 m depth, similar to Wyrtki Jet (WJ). Inter-monsoon Jets, i.e., spring and fall jets, are also seen but are in the opposite direction, i.e., westward, unlike eastward in WJ.

Specific long-term changes in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG modifications and antibody functions in mRNA, adenovector, and protein subunit vaccines.	Various vaccine platforms were developed and deployed against the COVID-19 disease. The Fc-mediated functions of IgG antibodies are essential in the adaptive immune response elicited by vaccines. However, the long-term changes of protein subunit vaccines and their combinations with mRNA vaccines are unknown. A total of 272 serum and plasma samples were collected from individuals who received first to third doses of the protein subunit Medigen, the mRNA (BNT), or the adenovector AstraZeneca vaccines. The IgG subclass level was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Fc-N glycosylation was measured using LC-MS/MS. Antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement deposition (ADCD) of anti-spike (S) IgG antibodies were measured. IgG1 and 3 reached the highest anti-S IgG subclass level. IgG1, 2, and 4 subclass levels significantly increased in mRNA- and Medigen-vaccinated individuals. Fc-glycosylation was stable, except in female BNT vaccinees, who showed increased bisection and decreased galactosylation. Female BNT vaccinees had a higher anti-S IgG titer than that of males. ADCP declined in all groups. ADCD increased in Medigen-vaccinated individuals after the third dose. Each vaccine produced specific long-term changes in Fc structure and function. This finding is critical when selecting a vaccine platform or combination to achieve the desired immune response.

Broad Epitope Coverage of Therapeutic Multi-Antibody Combinations Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Boosts In Vivo Protection and Neutralization Potency to Corner an Immune-Evading Virus.	Therapeutic antibodies (Abs) which act on a broader range of epitopes may provide more durable protection against the genetic drift of a target, typical of viruses or tumors. When these Abs exist concurrently on the targeted antigen, several mechanisms of action (MoAs) can be engaged, boosting therapeutic potency. This study selected combinations of four and five Abs with non- or partially overlapping epitopes to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, on or outside the crucial receptor binding domain (RBD), to offer resilience to emerging variants and trigger multiple MoAs. The combinations were derived from a pool of unique-sequence scFv Ab fragments retrieved from two SARS-CoV-2-naïve human phage display libraries.

The IL-7R antagonist lusvertikimab reduces leukemic burden in xenograft ALL via antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) arises from the uncontrolled proliferation of B-cell precursors (BCP-ALL) or T cells (T-ALL). Current treatment protocols obtain high cure rates in children but are based on toxic polychemotherapy. Novel therapies are urgently needed, especially in relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease, high-risk (HR) leukemias and T-ALL, in which immunotherapy approaches remain scarce. Although the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) plays a pivotal role in ALL development, no IL-7R-targeting immunotherapy has yet reached clinical application in ALL. The IL-7Rα chain (CD127)-targeting IgG4 antibody lusvertikimab (LUSV; formerly OSE-127) is a full antagonist of the IL-7R pathway, showing a good safety profile in healthy volunteers. Here, we show that ∼85% of ALL cases express surface CD127. We demonstrate significant in vivo efficacy of LUSV immunotherapy in a heterogeneous cohort of BCP- and T-ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDX) in minimal residual disease (MRD) and overt leukemia models, including R/R and HR leukemias. Importantly, LUSV was particularly effective when combined with polychemotherapy in a phase 2-like PDX study with CD127high samples leading to MRD-negativity in >50% of mice treated with combination therapy. Mechanistically, LUSV targeted ALL cells via a dual mode of action comprising direct IL-7R antagonistic activity and induction of macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). LUSV-mediated in vitro ADCP levels significantly correlated with CD127 expression levels and the reduction of leukemia burden upon treatment of PDX animals in vivo. Altogether, through its dual mode of action and good safety profile, LUSV may represent a novel immunotherapy option for any CD127+ ALL, particularly in combination with standard-of-care polychemotherapy.

Clinical Guideline for Preimplantation Genetic Testing in Inherited Cardiac Diseases.	Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is a reproductive technology that selects embryos without (familial) genetic variants. PGT has been applied in inherited cardiac disease and is included in the latest American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines. However, guidelines selecting eligible couples who will have the strongest risk reduction most from PGT are lacking. We developed an objective decision model to select eligibility for PGT and compared its results with those from a multidisciplinary team. All couples with an inherited cardiac disease referred to the national PGT center were included. A multidisciplinary team approved or rejected the indication based on clinical and genetic information. We developed a decision model based on published risk prediction models and literature, to evaluate the severity of the cardiac phenotype and the penetrance of the familial variant in referred patients. The outcomes of the model and the multidisciplinary team were compared in a blinded fashion. Eighty-three couples were referred for PGT (1997-2022), comprising 19 different genes for 8 different inherited cardiac diseases (cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias). Using our model and proposed cutoff values, a definitive decision was reached for 76 (92%) couples, aligning with 95% of the multidisciplinary team decisions. In a prospective cohort of 11 couples, we showed the clinical applicability of the model to select couples most eligible for PGT. The number of PGT requests for inherited cardiac diseases increases rapidly, without the availability of specific guidelines. We propose a 2-step decision model that helps select couples with the highest risk reduction for cardiac disease in their offspring after PGT.

Functional Signature of LRP4 Antibodies in Myasthenia Gravis.	Antibodies (Abs) specific for the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) occur in up to 5% of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). The objective of this study was to profile LRP4-Ab effector actions. We evaluated the efficacy of LRP4-specific compared with AChR-specific IgG to induce Ab-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and Ab-dependent complement deposition (ADCD). Functional features were additionally assessed in an independent AChR-Ab Effector actions that required binding of Fc domains to cellular FcRs such as ADCC and ADCP were detectable for both LRP4-specific and AChR-specific Abs. In contrast to AChR-Abs, LRP4-binding Abs showed poor efficacy in inducing complement deposition. Levels of circulating activated complement proteins were not substantially increased in LRP4-Ab-positive MG. Frequency of IgG glycovariants carrying 2 sialic acid residues, indicative for anti-inflammatory IgG activity, was decreased in patients with LRP4-Ab-positive MG. LRP4-Abs are more effective in inducing cellular FcR-mediated effector mechanisms than Ab-dependent complement activation. Their functional signature is different from AChR-specific Abs.

Compartment-Specific Antibody Correlates of Protection to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron in Macaques.	Antibodies represent a primary mediator of protection against respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Serum neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are often considered a primary correlate of protection. However, detailed antibody profiles including characterization of antibody functions in different anatomic compartments are not well understood. Here we show that antibody correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge are different in systemic versus mucosal compartments in rhesus macaques. In serum, neutralizing antibodies were the strongest correlate of protection and were linked to Spike-specific binding antibodies and other extra-neutralizing antibody functions that create a larger protective network. In contrast, in bronchiolar lavage (BAL), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) proved the strongest correlate of protection rather than NAbs. Within BAL, ADCP was linked to mucosal Spike-specific IgG, IgA/secretory IgA, and Fcγ-receptor binding antibodies. Our results support a model in which antibodies with different functions mediate protection at different anatomic sites. The correlation of ADCP and other Fc functional antibody responses with protection in BAL suggests that these antibody responses may be critical for protection against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron challenge in mucosa.

A Novel Dual-Fc Bispecific Antibody with Enhanced Fc Effector Function.	Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are undergoing continued development for applications in oncology and autoimmune diseases. While increasing activity by having more than one targeting arm, most BsAb engineering employs single Fc engagement as monoclonal antibodies. Here, we designed a novel immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1)-derived dual-Fc BsAb containing two Fc regions and two distinct asymmetric antigen binding arms comprising a Fab arm and another VHH domain. In conjunction with the knob-into-hole technology, dual-Fc BsAbs could be produced with a high yield and good stability. We explore how Fc engineering effects on dual-Fc constructs could boost the desired therapeutic efficacy. This new format enabled simultaneous bispecific binding to corresponding antigens. Furthermore, compared to the one-Fc control molecules, dual-Fc BsAbs were shown to increase the avidity-based binding to FcγRs to result in higher ADCC and ADCP activities by potent avidity via binding to two antigens and Fc receptors. Overall, this novel BsAb format with enhanced effector functionalities provides a new option for antibody-based immunotherapy.

Subtype recognition and identification of a prognosis model characterized by antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis-related genes in breast cancer.	Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous tumor with a variety of etiology and clinical features. Antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP) is the last step of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI), and macrophages detect and recognize tumor cells, then destroy and engulf tumor cells. Despite the large number, negative regulators that inhibit phagocytic activity are still a key obstacle to the full efficacy of ICI. An ADCP-related risk score prognostic model for risk stratification as well as prognosis prediction was established in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. The predictive value of ADCP risk score in prognosis and immunotherapy was also further validated in the TCGA along with International Cancer Genome Consortium cohorts. To promote the clinical application of the risk score, a nomogram was established, with its effectiveness verified by different methods. In this study, the genes collected from previous studies were defined as ADCP-related genes. In BC patients, two ADCP-related subtypes were identified. The immune characteristics and prognostic stratification were significant different between them. We identified two subtypes associated with ADCP gene expression in breast cancer. They have significant differences in immune cells, molecular functions, HLA family genes, immune scores, stromal scores, and inflammatory gene expression, which have important guiding significance for the selection of clinical treatment methods. At the same time, we constructed a risk model based on ADCP, and the risk score can be used as a good indicator of prognosis, providing potential therapeutic advantages for chemotherapy and immunotherapy, thus helping the clinical decision-making of BC patients.	antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis; breast cancer; immune checkpoint inhibition; prognostic biomarker; tumor microenvironment

Antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 have been extensively studied in the context of infections, vaccinations, and breakthrough infections. Antibodies, however, are pleiotropic proteins that have many functions in addition to neutralization. These include Fc-effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Although important to combat viral infections, these Fc-effector functions were less studied in the context of SARS-CoV-2 compared with binding and neutralization. This is partly due to the difficulty in developing reliable assays to measure Fc-effector functions compared to antibody binding and neutralization. Multiple assays have now been developed and can be used to measure different Fc-effector functions. Here, we review these assays and what is known regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 Fc-effector functions. Overall, this review summarizes and updates our current state of knowledge regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 Fc-effector functions.	ADCC; ADCP; Fc-effector functions; SARS-CoV-2; antibody

Identification of CD160-TM as a tumor target on triple negative breast cancers: possible therapeutic applications.	Despite major therapeutic advances, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) still presents a worth prognosis than hormone receptors-positive breast cancers. One major issue relies in the molecular and mutational heterogeneity of TNBC subtypes that is reinforced by the absence of reliable tumor-antigen that could serve as a specific target to further promote efficient tumor cell recognition and depletion. CD160 is a receptor mainly expressed by NK lymphocytes and presenting two isoforms, namely the GPI-anchored form (CD160-GPI) and the transmembrane isoform (CD160-TM). While CD160-GPI is constitutively expressed on resting cells and involved in the generation of NK cells' cytotoxic activity, CD160-TM is neo-synthesized upon activation and promotes the amplification of NK cells' killing ability. CD160 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry on TNBC patient biopsies or cell lines, respectively. Antibody (Ab)-mediated tumor depletion was tested in vitro by performing antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP) assays, and in vivo on a TNBC mouse model. Preliminary data obtained by IHC on TNBC patients' tumor biopsies revealed an unconventional expression of CD160 by TNBC tumor cells. By using a specific but conformation-dependent anti-CD160-TM Ab, we established that CD160-TM, but not CD160-GPI, was expressed by TNBC tumor cells. A conformation-independent anti-CD160-TM mAb (22B12; muIgG2a isotype) was generated and selected according to pre-defined specificity and functional criterions. In vitro functional assays demonstrated that ADCC and ADCP could be induced in the presence of 22B12, resulting in TNBC cell line apoptosis. The ability of 22B12 to exert an in vivo anti-tumor activity was also demonstrated on a TNBC murine model. Our data identify CD160-TM as a tumor marker for TNBC and provide a rational for the use of anti-CD160-TM antibodies as therapeutic tools in this tumor context.

Discovery and Characterization of a Pan-betacoronavirus S2-binding antibody.	Three coronaviruses have spilled over from animal reservoirs into the human population and caused deadly epidemics or pandemics. The continued emergence of coronaviruses highlights the need for pan-coronavirus interventions for effective pandemic preparedness. Here, using LIBRA-seq, we report a panel of 50 coronavirus antibodies isolated from human B cells. Of these antibodies, 54043-5 was shown to bind the S2 subunit of spike proteins from alpha-, beta-, and deltacoronaviruses. A cryo-EM structure of 54043-5 bound to the pre-fusion S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike defined an epitope at the apex of S2 that is highly conserved among betacoronaviruses. Although non-neutralizing, 54043-5 induced Fc-dependent antiviral responses, including ADCC and ADCP. In murine SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies, protection against disease was observed after introduction of Leu234Ala, Leu235Ala, and Pro329Gly (LALA-PG) substitutions in the Fc region of 54043-5. Together, these data provide new insights into the protective mechanisms of non-neutralizing antibodies and define a broadly conserved epitope within the S2 subunit.

Altered IgG4 Antibody Response to Repeated mRNA versus Protein COVID Vaccines.	Repeated mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been associated with increases in the proportion of IgG4 in spike-specific antibody responses and concurrent reductions in Fcγ-mediated effector functions that may limit control of viral infection. Here, we assessed anti-Spike total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, and surrogate markers for antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP, FcγRIIa binding), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC, FcγRIIIa binding), and antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD, C1q binding) associated with repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The NVX-CoV2373 protein vaccine did not induce notable increases in spike-specific IgG4 or negatively impact surrogates for Fcγ effector responses. Conversely, repeated NVX-CoV2373 vaccination uniquely enhanced IgG3 responses which are known to exhibit strong affinity for FcγRIIIa and have previously been linked to potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.

KLRG1 Cell Depletion as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy in Patients with Mature T-Cell Lymphoma Subtypes.	Develop a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with subtypes of mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms. Primary specimens, cell lines, patient-derived xenograft models, commercially available, and proprietary anti-KLRG1 antibodies were used for screening, target, and functional validation. Here we demonstrate that surface KLRG1 is highly expressed on tumor cells in subsets of patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL), T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), and gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma (G/D TCL). The majority of the CD8+/CD57+ or CD3-/CD56+ leukemic cells derived from patients with T- and NK-large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL and NK-LGLL), respectively, expressed surface KLRG1. The humanized afucosylated anti-KLRG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb208) optimized for mouse in vivo use depleted KLRG1+ TCL cells by mechanisms of ADCC, ADCP, and CDC rather than apoptosis. mAb208 induced ADCC and ADCP of T-LGLL patient-derived CD8+/CD57+ cells ex vivo. mAb208 effected ADCC of subsets of healthy donor-derived KLRG1+ NK, CD4+, CD8+ Tem, and TemRA cells while sparing KLRG1- naïve and CD8+ Tcm cells. Treatment of cell line and TCL patient-derived xenografts with mAb208 or anti-CD47 mAb alone and in combination with the PI3K-δ/γ inhibitor duvelisib extended survival. The depletion of macrophages in vivo antagonized mAb208 efficacy. Our findings suggest the potential benefit of a broader treatment strategy combining therapeutic antibodies with PI3Ki for the treatment of patients with mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms.

RBD-Protein/Peptide Vaccine UB-612 Elicits Mucosal and Fc-Mediated Antibody Responses against SARS-CoV-2 in Cynomolgus Macaques.	Antibodies provide critical protective immunity against COVID-19, and the Fc-mediated effector functions and mucosal antibodies also contribute to the protection. To expand the characterization of humoral immunity stimulated by subunit protein-peptide COVID-19 vaccine UB-612, preclinical studies in non-human primates were undertaken to investigate mucosal secretion and the effector functionality of vaccine-induced antibodies in antibody-dependent monocyte phagocytosis (ADMP) and antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) assays. In cynomolgus macaques, UB-612 induced potent serum-neutralizing, RBD-specific IgG binding, ACE2 binding-inhibition antibodies, and antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions in ADMP and ADNKA assays. Additionally, immunized animals developed mucosal antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BAL). The level of mucosal or serum ADMP and ADNKA antibodies was found to be UB-612 dose-dependent. Our results highlight that the novel subunit UB-612 vaccine is a potent B-cell immunogen inducing polyfunctional antibody responses contributing to anti-viral immunity and vaccine efficacy.

Characterization of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in patients infected with hepatitis C virus with different clinical outcomes.	Early neutralizing antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and CD8 + T cell effector responses can lead to viral clearance. However, these functions alone are not sufficient to protect patients against HCV infection, thus undefined additional antiviral immune mechanisms are required. In recent years, Fc-receptor-dependent antibody effector functions, particularly, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) were shown to offer immune protection against several RNA viruses. However, its development and clinical role in patients with HCV infection remain unknown. In this study, we found that patients with chronic GT1a or GT3a HCV infection had significantly higher concentrations of anti-envelope 2 (E2) antibodies, predominantly IgG1 subclass, than patients that cleared the viruses while the latter had antibodies with higher affinities. 97% of the patients with HCV had measurable ADCP of whom patients with chronic disease showed significantly higher ADCP than those who naturally cleared the virus. Epitope mapping studies showed that patients with antibodies that target antigenic domains on the HCV E2 protein that are known to associate with neutralization function are also strongly associated with ADCP, suggesting antibodies with overlapping/dual functions. Correlation studies showed that ADCP significantly correlated with plasma anti-E2 antibody levels and neutralization function regardless of clinical outcome and genotype of infecting virus, while a significant correlation between ADCP and affinity was only evident in patients that cleared the virus. These results suggest ADCP was mostly driven by antibody titer in patients with chronic disease while maintained in clearers due to the quality (affinity) of their anti-E2 antibodies despite having lower antibody titers.	affinity; epitope mapping; hepatitis C; neutralization; phagocytosis

Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have shown clinical efficacy in colorectal cancer and other solid cancers. Enhancing the effector functions of these anti-EGFR mAbs is believed to be a valuable approach to achieve improved efficacy in clinical setting. Here, we report the development of an effector function-enhanced antibody by rhamnose (Rha) functionalization. Cetuximab, a human/mouse chimeric anti-EGFR mAb, was selected and site-specifically conjugated with Rha haptens. The obtained cetuximab-Rha conjugate was shown to be able to selectively redirect amounts of endogenous anti-Rha antibodies onto EGFR-positive solid tumor cells and thereby provide more Fc domains to achieve enhancement of effector functions including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). Particularly, CDC, one powerful cell killing mechanism which is inactive in cetuximab, was dramatically improved. This study demonstrates the potential of rhamnose-modified antibody for EGFR-positive solid tumor immunotherapy.	ADCP; CDC; Cetuximab; EGFR; Rhamnose

Chimeric single-chain variable fragment-human immunoglobulin G crystallizable fragment antibody against GD2 for neuroblastoma targeted immunotherapy.	The present study aims to generate chimeric mouse single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) crystallizable fragment (Fc) antibody against disialoganglioside (GD2) for the treatment of neuroblastoma (NB). The generated scFv-IgG Fc antibody, lacking first constant domain of heavy chain (CH1), is of a smaller size than the natural antibody and has anti-tumor activity. Vector for scFv-IgG Fc antibody was constructed and scFv-IgG Fc antibody was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cell line. Purification of scFv-IgG Fc antibody from the culture supernatant of transfected HEK293T cells was performed by Protein G affinity chromatography. The structure and binding activity of scFv-IgG Fc antibody were verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), western blotting (WB), and immunofluorescence techniques. Anti-tumor activities by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) were determined. Using plasmid fusion-human IgG1-Fc2 tag vector (pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2), a plasmid vector encoding chimeric mouse scFv and hIgG1 Fc antibody against GD2 was successfully constructed. This vector was transfected into human HEK293T cells to produce scFv-IgG Fc antibody. The transfected HEK293T cells could produce chimeric scFv-IgG Fc antibody against GD2, which lacks the IgG heavy chain CH1 domain but carries CH2 and CH3 domains. The chimeric antibodies could be purified from the culture supernatant of the transfected HEK293T culture in the presence of zeocin drug. The produced GD2 scFv-IgG Fc antibodies, which are smaller in size than the intact antibody, could trigger the killing of GD2 expressed NB cell line SH-SY5Y by ADCC and ADCP mechanisms. The results indicate that chimeric scFv-hIgG Fc antibody, lacking heavy chain CH1 domain, could mediate antibody induced anti-tumor activities. The small size of this type of chimeric antibody may be employed as anti-GD2 antibody for NB therapy.

New Frontiers in Monoclonal Antibodies for Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive lymphoma. Approximately 60% of patients are cured with R-CHOP as a frontline treatment, while the remaining patients experience primary refractory or relapsed disease (R/R). The prognosis for R/R DLBCL patients who are neither eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantations nor CAR-T-cell treatment is poor, representing an important unmet need. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have dramatically improved therapeutic options in anti-cancer strategies, offering new opportunities to overcome chemo-refractoriness in this challenging disease, even in cases of primary non-responder DLBCL. Several novel mAbs, characterized by different mechanisms of action and targets, are now available for R/R DLBCL. Unbound mAbs induce an immune response against cancer cells, triggering different mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and radioimmunotherapy (RIT), respectively, deliver a cytotoxic payload or a beta-emitter radionuclide to the targeted cells and nearby bystanders. Bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTes) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) redirect and enhance the immune response against tumor cells. Here, we review therapeutic strategies based on monoclonal antibodies for R/R DLBCL.	antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; bispecific antibodies; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; immune checkpoint inhibitors; monoclonal antibodies; target therapy

Distinct effector functions mediated by Fc regions of bovine IgG subclasses and their interaction with Fc gamma receptors.	Cattle possess three IgG subclasses. However, the key immune functions, including complement and NK cell activation, and enhancement of phagocytosis, are not fully described for bovine IgG1, 2 and 3. We produced chimeric monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) consisting of a defined variable region linked to the constant regions of bovine IgG1, 2 and 3, and expressed His-tagged soluble recombinant bovine Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) IA (CD64), IIA (CD32A), III (CD16) and Fcγ2R. Functional assays using bovinized mAbs were developed. IgG1 and IgG3, but not IgG2, activated complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Only IgG1 could activate cattle NK cells to mobilize CD107a after antigen crosslinking, a surrogate assay for antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Both IgG1 and IgG2 could trigger monocyte-derived macrophages to phagocytose fluorescently labelled antigen-expressing target cells. IgG3 induced only weak antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). By contrast, monocytes only exhibited strong ADCP when triggered by IgG2. IgG1 bound most strongly to recombinant FcγRs IA, IIA and III, with weaker binding by IgG3 and none by IgG2, which bound exclusively to Fcγ2R. Immune complexes containing IgG1, 2 and 3 bound differentially to leukocyte subsets, with IgG2 binding strongly to neutrophils and monocytes and all subclasses binding platelets. Differential expression of the FcγRs on leukocyte subsets was demonstrated by surface staining and/or RT-qPCR of sorted cells, e.g., Fcγ2R mRNA was expressed in monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and platelets, potentially explaining their strong interactions with IgG2, and FcγRIII was expressed on NK cells, presumably mediating IgG1-dependent NK cell activation. These data reveal differences in bovine IgG subclass functionality, which do not correspond to those described in humans, mice or pigs, which is relevant to the study of these IgG subclasses in vaccine and therapeutic antibody development.

Two Cases of Degenerative Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy in Adults with Athetoid and Dystonic Cerebral Palsy.	BACKGROUND Patients with athetoid and dystonic cerebral palsy (ADCP) may develop degenerative changes in the cervical spine that can aggravate their neurological symptoms in adulthood. This report is of 2 cases of ADCP associated with degenerative cervical spondylotic myelopathy in a 39-year-old woman and a 52-year-old man, requiring different surgical treatments. CASE REPORT Case 1. The patient was a 39-year-old woman who had fallen down 7 years before surgery and had since been walking with a cane. Her gait disturbance had worsened in the 2 years prior to surgery, and numbness in her upper limbs appeared. In the year before surgery, spasticity and numbness in the lower limbs worsened, and fine motor impairment also appeared. Because of mild involuntary movements of the neck, cervical laminoplasty from C3 to C6 was performed, and her symptoms remained stable until the last follow-up 4.5 years after surgery. Case 2. The patient was a 52-year-old man who had fallen down 7 years before surgery, resulting in transient limb weakness. In the year before surgery, he had developed fine motor impairment. He subsequently developed gait disturbance and requested cervical surgery. Because of involuntary movements involving the neck and trunk, he underwent cervical posterior fusion from C2 to T1. Six months after surgery, the gait disturbance had improved. CONCLUSIONS This report describes 2 adults with a history of ADCP since birth and highlights that degenerative changes of the cervical spine can occur at a relatively early age in adulthood, requiring an individualized approach to management.

Benefits and challenges associated with implementation and ongoing use of automated dispensing cabinet for medicines: A scoping review.	When deciding whether to adopt a digital healthcare technology, there is a need to fully grasp the benefits as well as understand any potential challenges from the outset, to enable appropriate mitigations to be considered as part of implementation plans. Automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) have been increasingly used in hospitals as a means of streamlining medicines use workflows, facilitating medicine management, saving costs, and improving patient safety. Manufacturers commonly reference the benefits of ADCs but rarely outline the challenges. It is important that senior leaders in healthcare understand both the benefits and challenges of ADCs prior to implementation, to ensure the technology is implemented in areas where the benefits can be most maximally achieved and the challenges mitigated in so far as possible. A scoping review methodology was used to map existing literature focussing on the benefits and challenges of ADC use with medicines. Following a preliminary search to identify key terms, extensive literature searches were conducted in Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Global Health, and Web of Science. Among 234 articles identified from the search, 54 articles were included for full data extraction. Extracted information included publication date and origin, study aims & objectives, study setting, medication distribution model, technology infrastructure, overarching category, area of focus, and key findings. The findings were discussed in terms of implications for broad trends and future research directions. Although results indicate that there is an abundance of published literature on benefits and challenges associated with ADC use with medicines, there are only a handful of UK studies. Differences in settings, distribution models, workflows and technology infrastructure limit the overall ability to generalise findings. Further UK-based studies carried out in different settings with varying levels of technological infrastructure is imperative to not only track the impact of ADCs but also to inform practice to ensure the continued delivery of benefits. Further studies focusing particularly on the impact of stock optimisation and the management of CDs (Controlled drugs) would be key areas of focus.

Tumor heterogeneity is a major obstacle to effective targeted therapies, including those utilizing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Although some ADCs employ the bystander effect to eliminate neighboring antigen-negative cells, their efficacy often diminishes as antigen-positive cell populations decrease within heterogeneous tumors. To address this limitation in ADC therapies, we developed a novel ADC using a caspase substrate, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD), as a linker to generate a more potent and sustained bystander effect. The DEVD ADC effectively targeted antigen-positive cells and released its payload via cathepsin B cleavage. Notably, it exhibited a significant bystander effect mediated by the caspase-3-triggered extracellular cleavage of the linker, enhancing payload release into the tumor microenvironment. In breast cancer xenograft models, the DEVD ADC maintained its efficacy and continued to exert a bystander effect even after the depletion of antigen-positive cells, thereby overcoming challenges posed by tumor heterogeneity. These findings emphasize the potential of DEVD linkers in enhancing ADC efficacy against heterogeneous solid tumors, offering a promising strategy to improve therapeutic outcomes.

New frontiers in the pharmacological management of biliary tract carcinomas: the emerging role of drug conjugates.	Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a human malignancy with a poor prognosis. However, significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis, leading to the development of targeted therapy strategies in recent years. The challenge now is to develop new therapeutic concepts to further increase the efficacy of BTC treatments in the coming years. This review covers the emerging and advanced approaches of highly sophisticated antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and non-ADCs, particularly in relation to BTC. Additionally, the potential advantages and disadvantages of ADCs and non-ADCs regarding toxicities, bioavailability, and efficacy are presented and discussed. Given the poor prognosis of BTCs, new targeted and precision therapy strategies using drug conjugates - with and without antibodies as drug carriers - have the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional chemotherapy by improving treatment specificity and efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. However, several open questions remain regarding ADCs and non-ADCs, including chemical design, drug delivery, related diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers, and combinatory application strategies.

A Recognition Tag of Human Origin for Bioorthogonal Generation of Antibody-Drug Conjugates using Microbial Biotin Ligase.	The use of enzymes such as microbial transglutaminase, lipoate protein ligase A or sortase A for the generation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) has proven to be a powerful tool for the site-specific payload conjugation to tumor-specific antibodies. Here we report the extension of this enzymatic toolbox by Pyrococcus horikoshii biotin ligase (PhBL). To this end, the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab was equipped with p67, the 67 amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain of human propionyl-CoA carboxylase α subunit, at the C-terminus of either the light or heavy chain (Trz-LC:p67 and Trz-HC:p67). Upon incubation with PhBL, the azide-bearing linker desthiobiotin azide was site-specifically coupled to the p67 domains at the antibody. Subsequent strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) with DBCO-AF488 and DBCO-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE yielded conjugates near to full conversion. In cellular assays, these constructs exhibited single-digit nanomolar EC50 values in cellular proliferation assays on SK-BR-3 and A431 cells, where no significant difference in the performance between the two variants Trz-LC:p67-MMAE and Trz-HC:p67-MMAE was observed. On high Fc-γIIIa receptor expressing Jurkat cells, Trz-HC:p67-MMAE exhibited higher potency than Trz-LC:p67-MMAE, indicating an Fc-blocking effect of p67 when fused to the light chain.

Unlocking the Complexity of Antibody-Drug Conjugates: A Cutting-Edge LC-HRMS Approach to Refine Drug-to-Antibody Ratio Measurements with Highly Reactive Payloads.	"The complexity of therapeutic proteins like antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) holds a tremendous analytical challenge. Complementary mass spectrometry approaches such as peptide mapping and intact mass analysis are required for the in-depth characterization of these bioconjugates. Cysteine-linked ADCs have shown a unique challenge for characterization, mainly when the conjugation is carried out on interchain cysteines, because their intact analysis requires native mass spectrometry conditions to preserve non-covalent binding between antibody chains. In this work, two different approaches were proposed. Specifically, a full scan data-independent all ion fragmentation (FS-AIF) and a full scan data-dependent targeted MS2 (FS-ddtMS2) were applied to generate complementary datasets for a cysteine-linked ADC characterization with a highly reactive payload. These two methods were applied to in vitro plasma stability and in vivo PK samples to calculate and refine mean drug-to-antibody ratio over time. Using this approach, we successfully characterized an ADC containing a hydrolysis-sensitive payload and refined the ""active"" drug-to-antibody ratio on in vitro stability and in vivo samples. These two methods allowed the confirmation of the different ADC species and potential metabolites of conjugated payload attached to the antibody backbone in a single analysis without needing a dedicated method for the conjugated payload metabolite identification."	antibody–drug conjugates; drug discovery; drug-to-antibody ratio; liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry

Strategies to Overcome Resistance to Osimertinib in EGFR-Mutated Lung Cancer.	Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents the most common type of lung cancer. The majority of patients with lung cancer characterized by activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), benefit from therapies entailing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In this regard, osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI, has greatly improved the outcome for patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer. The AURA and FLAURA trials displayed the superiority of the third-generation TKI in both first- and second-line settings, making it the drug of choice for treating patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer. Unfortunately, the onset of resistance is almost inevitable. On-target mechanisms of resistance include new mutations (e.g., C797S) in the kinase domain of EGFR, while among the off-target mechanisms, amplification of MET or HER2, mutations in downstream signaling molecules, oncogenic fusions, and phenotypic changes (e.g., EMT) have been described. This review focuses on the strategies that are currently being investigated, in preclinical and clinical settings, to overcome resistance to osimertinib, including the use of fourth-generation TKIs, PROTACs, bispecific antibodies, and ADCs, as monotherapy and as part of combination therapies.

Monotherapy and combination therapy using antibody‑drug conjugates for platinum‑resistant ovarian cancer.	Platinum‑resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) is a significant clinical challenge due to the limited number of treatment options and poor outcomes. Moreover, cytotoxic drugs have an unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy, high toxicity and side effects. An antibody‑drug conjugate (ADC) is a novel cancer therapeutic strategy that combines an antibody, a linker and a payload. ADCs precisely target the tumor cells by binding to the antigen on the surface of tumor cells, thus accurately delivering the cytotoxic drugs and minimizing systemic toxicity. The approval of mirvetuximab soravtansine by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating folate receptor alpha‑positive, platinum‑resistant epithelial ovarian cancer has promoted studies on the use of ADCs in ovarian cancer. A phase III clinical trial showed that mirvetuximab soravtansine achieved an objective remission rate of 42.3% in platinum‑resistant, FRα‑positive ovarian cancer, compared with 15.9% using chemotherapy, demonstrating its immense potential for ADC development. The present review summarizes the research progress on the use of ADCs in PROC as a monotherapy and combination therapy and considers the future development direction of ADCs in PROC.	antibody‑drug conjugates; combination therapy; folate receptor alpha; ovarian cancer; platinum‑resistance

Association between HIV and cancer risk: a nationwide, population-based cohort study.	We aimed to examine whether people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PLWH) show different cancer incidences compared to individuals without HIV infection in South Korea. Population-based cohort study. This study included all PLWH diagnosed with HIV infections in South Korea between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017. The 2017 PLWH number includes both new and previous HIV diagnoses. The prevalence of newly diagnosed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers (ADCs) and non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) were evaluated from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022, as endpoints. Following 1:5 propensity score matching, 20,703 PLWH and 89,881 controls were included. The incidence rate of ADCs was 165.9 per 100,000 person-years in PLWH and 51.8 per 100,000 person-years in the controls. In the Cox regression analysis, PLWH had a 3.17-fold higher incidence of ADCs than in the controls (hazard ratio: 3.17, 95% confidence interval: 2.60, 3.86; P < 0.001). The incidence rate of NADCs was 1,614 per 100,000 person-years in PLWH and 1,888 per 100,000 person-years in the controls. In the Cox regression analysis, no significant difference was observed in the incidence of NADCs between PLWH and the control group (P = 0.101). However, PLWH showed a higher incidence of NADCs than in the controls for nasopharyngeal, anal, and non-melanoma skin cancers; Hodgkin lymphoma; and, leukemia. PLWH had a greater risk of ADCs than individuals without HIV infection. Among the NADCs, PLWH showed a greater risk of nasopharyngeal, anal, non-melanoma skin cancers; Hodgkin lymphoma; and, leukemia.	AIDS; Cancer; Cohort studies; HIV; Population

Targeting Lung Cancer with Precision: The ADC Therapeutic Revolution.	This review explores the evolving role of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in lung cancer treatment, with a focus on their application in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). It highlights advancements in ADC design, mechanisms of action, and key outcomes from recent clinical trials. ADCs have introduced a new level of precision in oncology by targeting tumor-specific antigens such as HER2, HER3, and TROP-2. Recent clinical trials of agents like trastuzumab deruxtecan, datopotamab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan have demonstrated meaningful objective response rates and manageable toxicity, offering hope for patients with advanced NSCLC and SCLC. ADCs are transforming the treatment landscape for lung cancer, offering a blend of targeted delivery and potent therapeutic effects. With ongoing efforts to improve safety, efficacy, and antigen targeting, ADCs have the potential to become a cornerstone of lung cancer therapy and pave the way for innovative multimodal approaches in the future.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting cell surface proteins TROP2 or HER2 are effective in metastatic breast cancer, but the precise clinical contribution of epitope expression is uncertain. We prospectively monitored circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in 33 patients receiving ADC therapies using quantitative imaging. The expression of TROP2 and HER2 are heterogeneous across single CTCs from untreated patients, comparable to matched tumor biopsies, and display poor association with clinical response. Within three weeks of treatment initiation, declining CTC numbers correlate with a durable response (TROP2: median time to progression 391 versus 97 days, HR 4.15, P=0.0046; HER2: 322 versus 66 days, HR 9.12, P=0.0002). Neither TROP2 nor HER2 expression is reduced at progression, compared to matched pretreatment CTCs, and switching ADC epitope while maintaining a similar payload shows poor efficacy. Thus, epitope downregulation is not a common driver of acquired resistance to TROP2 or HER2 ADCs, and second-line ADC therapies may benefit from distinct payloads. ADCs target tumor-associated antigens, followed by internalization and release of drug payloads. However, clinical studies of epithelial-targeting ADCs show efficacy despite low tumor epitope expression. Our finding that epitope downregulation does not commonly accompany acquired resistance suggests alternative drivers of clinical efficacy and the need for testing non-cross-resistant payloads to overcome resistance.

Analysis and interpretation of inflammatory fluid markers in Alzheimer's disease: a roadmap for standardization.	Growing interest in the role of the immune response in Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) has led to widespread use of fluid inflammatory markers in research studies. To standardize the use and interpretation of inflammatory markers in AD research, we build upon prior guidelines to develop consensus statements and recommendations to advance application and interpretation of these markers. In this roadmap paper, we propose a glossary of terms related to the immune response in the context of biomarker discovery/validation, discuss current conceptualizations of inflammatory markers in research, and recommend best practices to address key knowledge gaps. We also provide consensus principles to summarize primary conceptual, methodological, and interpretative issues facing the field: (1) a single inflammatory marker is likely insufficient to describe an entire biological cascade, and multiple markers with similar or distinct functions should be simultaneously measured in a panel; (2) association studies in humans are insufficient to infer causal relationships or mechanisms; (3) neuroinflammation displays time-dependent and disease context-dependent patterns; (4) neuroinflammatory mechanisms should not be inferred based solely on blood inflammatory marker changes; and (5) standardized reporting of CSF inflammatory marker assay validation and performance will improve incorporation of inflammatory markers into the biological AD criteria.

Multicenter retrospective cohort study of the sequential use of the antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and sacituzumab govitecan (SG) in patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (MBC).	Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have improved outcomes for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but there is little data about the sequential use of these agents. In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we identified 84 patients with HER2-low MBC treated sequentially with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and sacituzumab govitecan (SG) in either order at 5 institutions between 2020-2024. We evaluated clinical parameters associated with time to treatment failure (TTF) and real-world overall survival (rwOS). Median TTF was longer for ADC1 than ADC2, irrespective of HR-status, ADC sequence order, age ≤65 or >65 years, presence of visceral disease, or use of an intervening therapy. Younger age, longer time from MBC diagnosis to start of ADC1, and receipt of SG as ADC1 were associated with longer rwOS from start of ADC1. This cohort represents one of the first multicenter retrospective series of patients treated with sequential ADCs for HER2-low MBC, which may inform clinical practice.

Navigating the Landscape of Resistance Mechanisms in Antibody-Drug Conjugates for Cancer Treatment.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an innovative approach in cancer therapy, combining the specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy agents. Despite the remarkable efficacy demonstrated in clinical studies, primary and secondary resistance to ADCs represent a concern and a significant challenge. Known resistance mechanisms mainly involve the targeted tumor antigen; the internalization, trafficking, and cleavage processes; the cytotoxic payload; and the intrinsic tumor cell dynamics of cell death and cell signaling. Key strategies to overcome these resistance mechanisms include the use of antibodies targeting the same antigen but with different payloads, developing dual-payload ADCs that target multiple cellular pathways, switching from non-cleavable to cleavable linkers, and combining ADCs with other therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents. By improving our understanding of what underlies the mechanisms of resistance to ADCs and implementing and studying systems to overcome these mechanisms, as well as using innovative therapeutic combinations, ADCs have the potential to continue to play a fundamental role in the treatment of tumors, especially refractory ones, providing patients with more effective and long-lasting therapeutic options, as well as better outcomes.

Rapidly progressive pneumonitis days after receiving tisotumab vedotin: a new antibody-drug conjugate.	The emergence of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) shows promise for treating a variety of tumours by using target-specific monoclonal antibodies to deliver cytotoxic substances directly to cancer cells. Their clinical development, however, is often hindered by significant toxicities. We report a case of a woman in her late 50s who developed grade 4 pneumonitis after receiving tisotumab vedotin (TV) for recurrent, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. 5 days post infusion, the patient exhibited severe respiratory distress, marked by hypoxaemia and diffuse ground-glass opacities on imaging. After careful ruling out of infection and alveolar haemorrhage via bronchoscopy, a presumptive diagnosis of drug-induced pneumonitis was established given the temporal relationship to receiving TV. The patient was treated with high-dose intravenous steroids and immunoglobulin, leading to eventual recovery. This case exhibits the potential for severe pulmonary toxicity associated with TV and highlights the need for greater awareness and investigation of adverse effects related to ADCs.

Trop-2 expression in non-small cell lung cancer.	Trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has become an attractive target for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADC tumor target expression is essential in investigating the predictive value of Trop-2 and Trop-2 ADC efficacy. Although Trop-2 mRNA expression in NSCLC has been described, protein-level expression is poorly understood. We investigated Trop-2 expression landscape across multiple data and sample sets to characterize mRNA expression and address the gap in protein-expression profiling. Trop-2 expression was analyzed using available mRNA, mutation, and protein data in three datasets: (1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) included clinical-pathological and survival data in NSCLC adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma; (2) sample set 1 (adenocarcinoma) and (3) sample set 2 (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma) underwent sequencing and immunohistochemistry for Trop-2 RNA, protein (Robust Prototype Assay, SP295 clone) and mutation analysis. Trop-2 was highly expressed in NSCLC and expression was similar in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and across baseline characteristics including patient age, sex, and tumor stage. Trop-2 expression was not associated with clinically relevant genetic alterations. Trop-2 was not a prognostic factor in NSCLC (TCGA survival data). High Trop-2 expression in NSCLC was independent of evaluated baseline characteristics, histology, and driver alterations. Trop-2 protein expression at any level was observed in 82% to 90% of NSCLC across sample sets; similar proportions of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma expressed Trop-2. These data support broad Trop-2 ADC use in NSCLC.

Streamlining and improving controlled drug dispensary workload in a London teaching hospital following the implementation of automated dispensing cabinets on wards: A quality improvement project.	An efficiently run pharmacy dispensary has the potential to positively impact patients stay in hospital. Pharmacy dispensary providers work in a fast-paced, hectic environment and are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with workload demands. In order to meet the increasing demand on resources, pharmacy teams are incorporating Quality Improvement (QI) initiatives to improve efficiencies within systems for the purpose of freeing up nursing and pharmacy staff time, improve patient flow and improve patient safety. This QI project sought to develop a standardised inventory control formula for controlled drugs (CDs) stocked in ADCs in clinical locations in order to reduce the frequency of CD stock orders, minimise the requirement for manual nurse generated orders and in doing so streamline workload for dispensaries whilst ensuring sufficient CD stock holding levels in clinical locations. The introduction of ADCs corresponded with an increase in dispensary workload at the main hospital site at King's College Hospital (KCH). Retrospective time series analysis of the monthly CD dispensing data was analysed for Surgical and Trauma wards over a 27-month period using the Statistical Control Process (SPC) tool. Volume of stock CD dispensing transactions, volume of stock Vs non-stock CD dispensing transactions, volume of weekday vs weekend, morning, afternoon and out of hours CD stock workload were measured. Two interventions were implemented: (i) stock optimisation informed by the utilisation of CD dispensing data issued from the ADC in central pharmacy; (ii) stocklist rationalisation to ensure the most commonly used CDs were added to CD stocklists and the least commonly used CDs were removed from stocklists in addition to the development of a standardised inventory management formula. The main outcome measure was the volume of stock CD dispensing transactions processed by central pharmacy. Secondary outcome measures included the volume of stock CD dispensing transactions at weekends Vs weekdays in addition to the split in workload between mornings, afternoons and out of hours. A reduction in stock CD workload for Surgical and Trauma wards was demonstrated following the stock optimisation review whereas this was not significantly impacted by the stock rationalisation or application of the standardised inventory management formula. Weekend workload reduced by 30 % in comparison to pre-ADC baseline period. Morning, afternoon and out of hours CD stock workload demonstrated a sustained improvement following stock optimisation, stock rationalisation and following the application of the standardised inventory management formula. The only exception to this sustained improvement was in October 2023 following the implementation of a new Trust wide EMPA system. The perfect formula to determine CD stock inventory levels remains elusive, however, as nurses are still required to order stock manually via CD requisition books for stock CD requests. Continual cycles of reviews are made possible through improved ease of data availability with the use of ADCs. Suggestions to further improve the formula are explored although not tested as part of this QI. The proposed improvements to the standardised formula together with more widespread application to different specialties is recommended as the next steps to this QI.

SNX10 deficiency impairs sensitivity to anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates via altering HER2 trafficking in HER2-positive breast cancer.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a rapidly developing therapeutic approach in cancer treatment that has shown remarkable efficacy in breast cancer. Despite the promising efficacy of anti-HER2 ADCs, many patients are still experiencing disease progression under treatment. Here, by analyzing the transcriptome data from patient-derived organoid models, I-SPY2 trial, and resistant cell lines, we identified that SNX10 deficiency conferred anti-HER2 ADCs resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer. Low levels of SNX10 attenuated HER2 recycling and promoted HER2 trafficking into lysosomes. Furthermore, we found the underlying mechanism of SNX10 in HER2 traffic by regulating the endosomal RAB11A. We propose that SNX10 deficiency contributes to the inhibition of HER2 recycling as well as the decrease of cell-surface HER2 and causes anti-HER2 ADC resistance.	antibody–drug conjugates; breast cancer; drug resistance

"Age-related diseases imposed heavy burdens to the healthcare systems globally, while cell senescence served as one fundamental molecular/cellular basis for these diseases. How to tackle the senescence-relevant problems is a hotspot for biomedical research. In this review article, the hallmarks and molecular pathways of cell senescence were firstly discussed, followed by the introduction of the current anti-senescence strategies, including senolytics and senomorphics. With suitable physical or chemical properties, multiple types of nanomaterials were used successfully in senescence therapeutics, as well as senescence detection. Based on the accumulating knowledges for senescence, the rules of how to use these nanoplatforms more efficiently against senescence were also summarized, including but not limited to surface modification, material-cargo interactions, factor responsiveness etc. The comparison of these ""senescence-selective"" nanoplatforms to other treatment options (prodrugs, ADCs, PROTACs, CART etc.) was also given. Learning from the past, nanotechnology can add more choice for treating age-related diseases, and provide more (diagnostic) information to further our understanding of senescence process."

Selecting optimal candidates for next-generation anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) remains challenging. We conduct a prespecified translational study to identify treatment biomarkers in SHR-A1811-treated HER2-positive breast cancer patients from the phase 2 neoadjuvant FASCINATE-N trial using DNA and RNA sequencing, computational pathology, and single-cell in situ spatial imaging. In the hormone receptor (HR)-negative subgroup, a higher proportion and more infiltration of immune cells (i.e., tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TILs]), particularly cytotoxic T cells, are associated with better treatment responses. In the HR-positive subgroup, the closeness and aggregation of HER2-strong-positive tumor cells, as opposed to a uniform distribution, are linked to a lower response rate and HER2 luminal-like (HER2-LUM) subtype, which more closely resembles HR+/HER2- breast cancer. In addition, we develop a clinically practical predictive model capable of predicting neoadjuvant treatment responses to SHR-A1811 and other novel ADCs based on clinicopathological characteristics and pathological images.

Machine Learning for Predicting the Drug-to-Antibody Ratio (DAR) in the Synthesis of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs).	The pharmaceutical industry faces challenges in developing efficient and cost-effective drug delivery systems. Among various applications, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) stand out by combining cytotoxic or bioactive agents with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for targeted therapies. However, bioconjugation methods can produce different outcomes, including no bioconjugation, depending on the mAb, the amino acid residues, and the linker-payload (LP) system used. In this work, we developed a machine learning (ML) algorithm capable of predicting bioconjugation outcomes, allowing the design of the best mAb, LP systems, and conditions for the development of efficient ADCs. In particular, we exploited the potential of the XGBoost algorithm in predicting the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) in the synthesis of ADCs. Our model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with

Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Antibody-Drug Conjugates: A Promising Approach for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.	Prostate cancer (PCa), especially metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), is a significant cancer characterized by its poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has emerged as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for PCa due to its restricted expression in malignant prostate tissues. In this case, several PSMA-targeting molecules were developed for radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel therapeutic approach for various carcinomas that can selectively target PSMA-positive tumor cells and minimize off-target toxicity. ADCs have made great progress in the treatment of breast and bladder cancers, and some have received FDA approval for target therapy. However, studies on PSMA ADCs are limited, and most clinical trials are at stage I or II. Therefore, this study reviewed trials about PSMA-targeting ADCs for the treatment of PCa. Clinical trials have reported a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and antitumor activity. Toxicity studies have revealed manageable adverse effects, with no significant off-target toxicity in PSMA-negative tissues. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of PSMA ADCs for the treatment of mCRPC. However, it also emphasizes the necessity of further clinical investigation to optimize efficacy, safety, and patient outcomes.	chemotherapy; metastasis; prostate neoplasm; systemic therapy; target therapy

B7 Homolog 4 (B7-H4)-Directed Agents in Oncology Clinical Trials: A Review.	B7 homolog 4 (B7-H4) is a transmembrane protein found on immune cells and is frequently overexpressed in various solid tumors, making it a promising target for cancer therapy. B7-H4-directed agents, particularly antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) like puxitatug samrotecan (AZD8205), felmetatug vedotin (SGN-B7H4V), and GSK5733584, have demonstrated early clinical activity with promising response rates in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Combination strategies, such as ADCs with anti-PD-1 or PARP inhibitor therapies, have also shown enhanced tumor regression in preclinical models and are the subject of several ongoing clinical trials. This review highlights the current landscape of B7-H4-targeted agents, their progress in clinical trials, and the potential for combination approaches to improve outcomes in B7-H4-expressing cancers.

Sacituzumab tirumotecan in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with or without EGFR mutations: phase 1/2 and phase 2 trials.	Trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a promising anticancer agent that has shown remarkable efficacy in several malignancies. However, in lung cancer, two phase 3 trials on TROP2-ADCs in unselected patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have both failed. Sacituzumab tirumotecan (sac-TMT) is a novel TROP2-directed ADC. Here we report the efficacy and safety of sac-TMT in previously treated, advanced NSCLC with or without activating EGFR mutations from the phase 1/2 KL264-01 and phase 2 SKB264-II-08 studies. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). KL264-01 enrolled EGFR-wild-type and EGFR-mutant NSCLC (n = 43). Confirmed ORR was 40% (17 of 43; 95% confidence interval (CI), 25-56). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.2 months (95% CI, 5.3-11.3). Post-hoc subgroup analyses found better outcomes in the EGFR-mutant subset (22 of 43, 51%) with a confirmed ORR of 55% (12 of 22) and median PFS of 11.1 months. These findings were independently supported by results from SKB264-II-08, where sac-TMT led to confirmed ORR of 34% (22 of 64; 95% CI, 23-47) and median PFS of 9.3 months (95% CI, 7.6-11.4) in 64 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. For a total of 107 patients receiving sac-TMT, the most common treatment-related adverse events were hematologic toxicities. Diarrhea (4%) and interstitial lung disease (1%) were uncommon. Exploration of potential mechanisms revealed that the presence of EGFR mutation substantially increased the internalization and activity of sac-TMT in vitro. Overall, sac-TMT showed encouraging single-agent activity and manageable tolerability in previously treated, advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations. Randomized phase 3 trials in treatment-naive and previously treated patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC are ongoing. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT04152499 , NCT05631262 .

Current update on pharmacological strategies of penile cancer.	Penile cancer considered an orphan malignancy - due to its low incidence - makes research and clinical development challenging. The limited understanding of molecular biology and genetic landscape adds to the complexity of developing effective therapies. This review takes a closer look at how penile cancer treatment has evolved - from traditional modes like surgery and radiation to now vaccines - over the period of time. Breakthroughs in immunotherapy offer a ray of hope alongside treatments like adoptive T-cell therapies (ATCT), anti-angiogenic agents, Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs), and Bispecific Antibodies (BsAbs). The integration of immunotherapy and targeted therapy has demonstrated promising results, particularly in patients with advanced or metastatic disease. While these advancements bring hope, more research is needed to refine treatment strategies to benefit patients from these novel approaches.

Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ASP1235 in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia: A phase 1 study.	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy. Although new agents including targeted therapies for relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML have been introduced, poor outcomes remain, requiring the need for novel approaches. One novel approach is the use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). We conducted an early phase clinical trial with ASP1235, an ADC targeting FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3. In total, 43 patients with R/R AML were treated with ASP1235. The most common adverse events (AEs) included elevated liver transaminase levels, ocular toxicity, and muscular weakness. Ocular treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were observed in 53 % of patients; most were mild or moderate in severity. The most common ocular TEAEs were blurred vision, dry eye, keratitis, photophobia, and reduced visual acuity. Serious (grade ≥3) ocular TEAEs occurred in 16.3 % of patients, with only 1 patient experiencing grade 4 keratitis. Six patients achieved composite complete remission (complete remission [CR] + CR with incomplete hematologic recovery + CR with incomplete platelet recovery), 2 of whom proceeded to hematopoietic cell transplantation with long-term leukemia-free survival. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02864290.	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML); Antibody-drug conjugate; FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3

Impact of pimavanserin on prescribing practices in parkinson disease.	"Parkinson disease psychosis (PDP) is a common complication of PD. Until 2016, the only drugs available to treat PDP in the U.S. were antipsychotics with variable degrees of dopamine-receptor antagonism (DRA) that may worsen PD motor symptoms. We evaluated the impact that pimavanserin, a selective serotonin receptor inverse agonist/antagonist atypical antipsychotic (AAP) with no known DRA, had on PDP treatment practices in a commercially insured population. We included adults diagnosed with PD who filled at least one AAP prescription from 2016 to 2022. AAP dispensings were categorized into (1) pimavanserin, (2) clozapine and quetiapine (i.e., PDP-""preferred"" mixed receptor antagonist AAPs), and (3) the remaining AAPs (i.e., PDP-""nonpreferred"" mixed receptor antagonist AAPs). Trends in quarterly dispensing rates per 1000 persons treated were compared across categories. Secondary analyses focused on the 65+ subpopulations insured by Medicare Advantage programs. Dispensing rates varied between 4 and 697/1000 persons treated for pimavanserin, 1434-1821 for preferred, and 394-746 for nonpreferred AAPs. Pimavanserin dispensings surpassed the nonpreferred category after quarter 3 of 2018. However, preferred AAPs, particularly quetiapine, remained the most dispensed category in the sixth year after pimavanserin's approval. We observed similar trends among Medicare Advantage enrollees. The availability of pimavanserin was followed by a decline in the use of the most harmful AAPs in persons living with PD. Quetiapine remained the most prescribed AAP. Comparative safety and effectiveness studies are needed to define the relative risks and benefits of treatment options in PDP."

Regulated bioanalysis of antibody-drug conjugates using LC-MS.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging as powerful tools in cancer therapy. Evaluating their drug disposition requires the development and validation of analytical methods to obtain accurate quantitative results, which depend on understanding the ADC structural properties and selecting appropriate analytical platforms. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a key technology for ADC bioanalysis, enabling the quantification of payloads, linkers, total antibodies, ADCs, and drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). This review highlights the strategies and challenges in developing analytical methods for quantifying ADC components in biological samples using LC-MS with a focus on their constituent units. In addition, it addresses the validation requirements of these quantitative analytical methods during drug development.	ADC; DAR; LC-MS; conjugated antibody; payload; total antibody; validation

Pharmacovigilance study of adverse reactions of anti-HER-2 drugs for the treatment of HER-2-positive breast cancer based on the FAERS database.	"There are three categories of drugs that treat human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER-2) positive breast cancer: monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The purpose of this study is to analyze and compare the adverse reactions of three classes of anti-HER-2 drugs to various body systems in patients based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). All data reports were extracted from the FAERS between 2004 and 2024. Data mining of adverse events associated with anti-HER-2 drugs was carried out using disproportionality analysis. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the risk factors associated with AEs leading to hospitalization. A total of 47,799 patients were screened for the three classes of drugs, among which ADC drugs caused the largest proportion of deaths. MAb has the strongest ADR signals associated with ""cardiac disorders"". Moreover, trastuzumab was associated with a greater risk of cardiotoxicity. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the treatment with mAbs should be wary of serious adverse reactions in ""infections and infestations"" and ""metabolism and nutrition disorders"". Moreover, ""endocrine disorders"" were the factor associated with the highest risk of prolonged hospitalization due to trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). The safety of tucatinib among TKI drugs is greater than that of other drugs. In general, from the perspective of the effects of the three classes of drugs on the various body systems of patients, we should focus on mAb-associated ""cardiac disorders"", ADC-associated ""hepatobiliary disorders"", ""respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders"", and TKI-associated ""gastrointestinal disorders."

A growing number of antibody‒drug conjugates (ADCs) have been approved for breast cancer treatment. However, the proper sequential strategies of ADCs remain uncertain. Our study aimed to explore the ideal ADC sequential treatment strategies in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-expressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Our multi-centre retrospective study enrolled MBC patients who received at least 2 lines of different types of ADCs between Jan 1, 2018, and Jul 1, 2024. The efficacy of both ADC1 and ADC2 was evaluated. A total of 111 patients (83 HER2-positive and 28 HER2-low) were included. In HER2-positive populations, Patients who received ADC2 with a different payload from ADC1 exhibited significantly longer progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) (6.8 vs. 2.7 months, p < 0.001) and overall PFS (progression-free Interval 1 (PFI1) + PFS2) (15.0 vs. 8.5 months, p = 0.043) compared to those treated with ADC2 containing a similar payload with ADC1. Patients received ADC2 immediately after ADC1 progression showed longer PFS2 ADC2 delayed sequential patients (median PFS2: 6.0 vs. 3.0 months, p = 0.004). In HER2-low patients, the efficacy of ADC2 tended to be lower than ADC1 (median PFI1 vs. PFS2: 3.1 vs. 2.4 months, p = 0.078). No significant differences of efficacy were observed, no matter what ADC sequential treatment strategy used. Sequential treatment with ADCs showed clinical benefit especially for HER2-positive patients treated with ADC2 which have different types of payloads from ADC1. In HER2-low patients, the benefit of ADC sequential therapy seemed to be limited.	Metastatic breast cancer; Sequential treatment strategy; antibody‒drug conjugate

Ophthalmotoxicity induced by antibody-drug conjugates: a pharmacovigilance study of the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS).	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy in refractory cancers, however, ophthalmotoxicity remains a serious concern. This study aimed to investigate the association between ADCs and ophthalmotoxicity. A retrospective pharmacovigilance study was conducted utilizing data extracted from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) from 2004 to 2023. Disproportionality analyses were performed using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC), with sensitivity analyses and subgroup evaluations by age and sex. A total of 1992 cases of ophthalmotoxicity linked to ADCs were identified, with a median latency of 40 days. The correlation between ophthalmotoxicity and ADCs was higher than with other medications (IC = 0.67, 95% CI:0.64-0.70). Signal detection revealed 36 adverse events unreported in product labeling. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our results on the association between ADCs and ocular toxicity, with higher reporting in females compared to males (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.11-1.40). ADCs had different profiles of ophthalmotoxicity. Our pharmacovigilance study suggested increased reporting of ophthalmotoxicity associated with ADCs.

Antibody-drug conjugates in breast cancer treatment: resistance mechanisms and the role of therapeutic sequencing.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a transformative approach in breast cancer therapy, offering targeted treatment with reduced toxicity by selectively delivering cytotoxic agents to cancer cells. While ADCs like trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), and sacituzumab govitecan have shown significant efficacy, resistance mechanisms such as antigen loss, impaired internalization, and efflux of cytotoxic payloads challenge their effectiveness. This review discusses these resistance mechanisms and explores advanced strategies to overcome them, including innovations in linker chemistry, multi-antigen targeting, and biomarker-driven personalization. Additionally, therapeutic sequencing - determining the optimal order of ADCs with other treatments such as chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and immunotherapy - is examined as a crucial approach to maximize ADC efficacy and manage resistance. Evidence-based sequencing strategies, particularly for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are supported by clinical trials demonstrating the benefits of ADCs in both early-stage and metastatic settings. The potential of combination therapies, such as ADCs with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), further highlights the evolving landscape of breast cancer treatment. As ADC technology advances, personalized approaches integrating biomarkers and optimized sequencing protocols offer promising avenues to enhance treatment outcomes and combat resistance in breast cancer.

Emerging Paradigms in Genitourinary Cancers: Integrating Molecular Imaging, Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Targeted Therapies, and Antibody-Drug Conjugates in Renal Cell and Urothelial Carcinomas.	Novel approaches in molecular imaging and targeted therapeutics are transforming the management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and urothelial carcinoma (UC). This review focuses on three key areas of innovation: molecular imaging, hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α) inhibition, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). In molecular imaging, prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography has shown promise in RCC, while novel tracers targeting carbonic anhydrase IX and nectin-4 are emerging for RCC and UC, respectively. These approaches may enable better characterization of disease and treatment response monitoring. HIF-2α inhibition represents a breakthrough in targeting the fundamental pathobiology of clear cell RCC, with belzutifan demonstrating significant clinical benefit in both von Hippel-Lindau disease and sporadic RCC. Next-generation HIF-2α inhibitors, including casdatifan, show promising early clinical results with distinct pharmacologic properties. ADCs have become a cornerstone of UC treatment, with enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab now approved as first-line therapy. Multiple human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed ADCs have shown efficacy in HER2-expressing UC, including trastuzumab deruxtecan, which recently received tumor-agnostic approval. While ADC development in RCC faces unique challenges, novel approaches including immunostimulatory payloads and bispecific antibodies are being explored. The integration of these advances in molecular imaging and therapeutics offers opportunities for more personalized treatment approaches in RCC and UC.

Discovery of a Novel ADC for Multifunctional Theranostics: From Vascular Normalization to Synergistic Therapy.	Previous studies have shown the potential of bevacizumab-based ADCs in tumor vascular normalization and chemotherapy synergies. Here, in order to improve the tumor treatment efficiency of ADC and further avoid drug resistance, we introduced the previously discovered photodynamic therapy group PDT into bevacizumab, which has high reactive oxygen generation efficiency and deep tissue penetration ability, and has surprising imaging effect on solid tumors. At the same time, doxorubicin, a chemotherapy drug molecule with strong cytotoxicity, has also been introduced to construct novel multifunctional integrated antibody-drug conjugates, Bevacizumab-DOX-PDT. It is proved that novel ADCs have the antigen-antibody binding ability similar to bevacizumab, while also possess strong antitumor activity and vascular normalization activity. In addition, it also showed great tracer ability for transplanted tumors. In summary, the novel ADC showed a surprising vascular normalization-chemotherapy-photodynamic synergistic therapeutic effect, which further enriched the expansion of vascular normalization in the field of new drug discovery.

Diffusion levels for quantitative assessment of the apparent diffusion coefficient value in prostate MRI: a proof-of-concept bicentric study.	To investigate the performance of Diffusion levels (DLs) in diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) when combined with the PI-RADS version 2.1. This retrospective, bicentric study included 261 men who underwent 3.0-T prostate MRI between March 2020 and April 2023, receiving systematic and target prostate biopsy on PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions. Two readers measured the Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of PI-RADS 1-5 findings in the peripheral zone. By plotting the cumulative frequency of csPCa versus ADCs and using ROC analysis, we derived four DLs expressing levels of restricted diffusion, i.e., very low DL (VL-DL), low DL (L-DL), intermediate DL (I-DL), and high DL (H-DL). We compared the per-lesion diagnostic performance in assessing csPCa (grading group ≥ 2 cancer) assuming to biopsy PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions (strategy 1), PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions adjusted with ADC values (strategy 2-4), and PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions adjusted with DLs (strategy 5-7). Net benefit was assessed with decision curve analysis. csPCa was found in 79/261 men (30.3%) and 152/528 lesions (28.8%). There was a negative correlation (p < 0.0001) between ADC versus malignancy rate (tau -0.970) and DLs versus csPCa grading group (tau -0.614). csPCa prevalence was highest in VL-DL (72.2%) and L-DL (54.4%). Most DLs-based strategies increased specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and net benefit compared to ADC-based strategies or PI-RADS alone. The best strategy showed 94.7% sensitivity, 82.9% specificity, 69.2% PPV, and 97.5% negative predictive value. While larger-scale validation is needed, DLs have the potential to improve PI-RADS-based biopsy decisions for detecting csPCa in the peripheral zone. Question It is still unclear how to incorporate quantitative information from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) into prostate MRI. Findings Combining DWI-derived diffusion levels (DLs) with the PI-RADS version 2.1 categorization reduced false positives while preserving high sensitivity for clinically significant prostate cancer. Clinical relevance DLs permit to easily account for ADC values of prostate lesions and, in turn, refine biopsy decisions.

Navigating the future of gastric cancer treatment: a review on the impact of antibody-drug conjugates.	Gastric cancer, marked by its high incidence and poor prognosis, demands the urgent development of novel and effective treatment strategies, especially for patients ineligible for surgery or those who have had limited success with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. Recently, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have become a key area of investigation due to their high specificity and potent antitumor effects. These therapies combine monoclonal antibodies, designed to bind to tumor-specific antigens, with cytotoxic agents that selectively target and destroy malignant cells. ADCs have generated significant interest in clinical trials as a promising approach to improve both treatment efficacy and patient outcomes in gastric cancer. However, their clinical application is not without challenges and limitations that must be addressed. This review discusses the recent progress in the use of ADCs for gastric cancer treatment.

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy among women and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Although improvements in early detection and therapy have been made, metastatic breast cancer (mBC) continues to be an incurable disease. Although existing treatments can prolong survival and enhance quality of life, they do not provide a definitive cure. Targeted therapies have significantly improved outcomes, particularly for subtypes such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HR+) BC. Key innovations include antibodydrug conjugates (ADCs) and next-generation endocrine therapies. ADCs combine monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic agents, allowing targeted delivery to tumor cells while minimizing systemic toxicity. Immunotherapy is emerging as a promising approach for aggressive subtypes, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Strategies under investigation include chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies, and natural killer (NK) cell treatments, all aimed at enhancing the ability of the immune system to target and eliminate resistant tumor cells. Tissue engineering, particularly hydrogel-based delivery systems, offers the potential for localized treatment. These systems enable the controlled release of therapeutic agents or immune cells directly to the tumor site, supporting tissue regeneration and enhancing immune surveillance to reduce recurrence. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including treatment resistance, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and high costs. Overcoming these barriers requires further innovation in drug delivery systems and a deeper understanding of tumor biology.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths following lung cancer in recent years. Therefore, lung or colorectal cancer therapy is very important for reducing mortality. In this study, we developed and characterized CD47-specific antibody-drug conjugates, namely 7DC-DM1 ADCs, to evaluate their therapeutic effects on lung and colorectal cancer. Both 7DC2-DM1 and 7DC4-DM1 demonstrated good binding affinities of 0.56 nM and 0.49 nM, respectively, and exhibited significant cytotoxicity, though they displayed different penetration effects. These findings suggest that the binding complexes of 7DC2-DM1 and 7DC4-DM1 with CD47 receptors adopt different conformations, leading to variations in their cellular internalized efficiencies. Molecular docking simulations revealed that 7DC2 and 7DC4 bind to CD47 molecules in distinct orientations and epitopes, differing between conserved and non-conserved regions. Furthermore, treatments with 7DC2-DM1 and 7DC4-DM1 displayed notable differences in antitumor effects in murine syngeneic tumor models derived from the MC38 cell line in C57BL/6 mice. In the tumor model treated with 7DC4-DM1, immunofluorescence staining analysis revealed a large area of necrosis in the tumor stroma, accompanied by a significant infiltration of CD11b-expressing immune cells. In summary, these results indicate that 7DC4-DM1 holds promise as a therapeutic agent for colorectal cancer treatment.

Since the approval of Mylotarg™ in 2000 for acute myeloid leukemia, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have significantly advanced precision medicine, particularly for oncology applications. ADCs combine an antibody, a linker, and a payload to result in a targeted therapeutic that minimizes toxicity resulting from systemic drug exposure. This review explores the innovative application of ADC technology towards immunosuppressive therapeutics, primarily focusing on antibody-mediated delivery of glucocorticoids (GCs). Despite their potent anti-inflammatory effects, the clinical use of GCs is limited by adverse systemic effects including osteoporosis, high blood sugar, adrenal insufficiency, weight gain, and glaucoma. Therefore, targeted delivery via ADCs presents a promising strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy while reducing toxicity. Herein, we review the current status of immune-suppressing ADC technology, starting with early investigations of CD163-targeted dexamethasone and moving to the design of ADCs employing next-generation ultra-potent GCs. Additionally, we will discuss the current status of anti-inflammatory ADCs that employ non-glucocorticoid immune-suppressive medications. Throughout, we will highlight preclinical and clinical data that serves to derisk and drive investment in this new therapeutic class. In parallel, we will focus on ADC design principles that illustrate the importance of careful selection of payload, linker, and conjugation technology in this emerging field.

Significance of HPV status on tumor response and treatment outcomes in endocervical adenocarcinoma treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy: a retrospective study.	We aimed to compare tumor response and treatment outcomes between human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated (HPVA) and HPV-independent (HPVI) endocervical adenocarcinomas (ADCs) treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and to identify prognostic factors. We conducted a retrospective review of 40 patients with endocervical ADCs treated with definitive CCRT (stages I-IVA) between 2011 and 2022. Based on pathological review the cases were categorized as HPVA or HPVI ADCs. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the characteristics, complete response (CR) rates, and survival outcomes. Of 40 patients, 22 (55.0%) had HPVA and 18 (45.0%) had HPVI ADCs. HPVI patients had significantly higher rates of parametrial invasion (94.4% vs. 45.5%, p=0.001). CR was achieved in 57.5% of patients and was significantly more common in the HPVA group (81.8% vs. 27.8%, p=0.001). Patients with HPVI had higher recurrence rates (88.9% vs. 50.0%, p=0.016) and lower 3-year progression-free survival (PFS, 16.7% vs. 49.8%, p=0.001), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS, 38.1% vs. 80.8%, p=0.001), and overall survival (OS, 42.3% vs. 90.7%, p=0.002) rates. HPVA remained a significant factor for PFS (hazard ratio [HR]=3.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.09-10.81; p=0.035) and OS rates (HR=6.83; 95% CI=1.17-39.80; p=0.033) in multivariate analysis. HPVI ADC was associated with a lower response to definitive CCRT and worse prognosis than HPVA ADC. These findings suggest the need for tailored treatment strategies based on the HPV status.

Pancreatic Cancer: Pathogenesis and Clinical Studies.	Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal malignancy, with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) being the most common and aggressive subtype, characterized by late diagnosis, aggressive progression, and resistance to conventional therapies. Despite advances in understanding its pathogenesis, including the identification of common genetic mutations (e.g., KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4) and dysregulated signaling pathways (e.g., KRAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and TGF-β pathways), effective therapeutic strategies remain limited. Current treatment modalities including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and emerging therapies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells, oncolytic viruses (OVs), cancer vaccines, and bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), face significant challenges. This review comprehensively summarizes these treatment approaches, emphasizing their mechanisms, limitations, and potential solutions, to overcome these bottlenecks. By integrating recent advancements and outlining critical challenges, this review aims to provide insights into future directions and guide the development of more effective treatment strategies for PC, with a specific focus on PDAC. Our work underscores the urgency of addressing the unmet needs in PDAC therapy and highlights promising areas for innovation in this field.	gene alteration; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; personalized management; signaling pathways; treatment development

HER2-positive gastric cancer: from targeted therapy to CAR-T cell therapy.	Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent cancer on a global scale, with HER2-positive GC representing a distinct subtype that exhibits more intricate biological characteristics. Conventional chemotherapy typically exhibits restricted efficacy in the management of HER2-positive GC. In light of the incessant advancement in molecular targeted therapies, targeting HER2 has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for this subtype. The advent of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has furnished novel treatment alternatives for HER2-positive GC. Nevertheless, owing to the pronounced heterogeneity of GC and the complex tumor microenvironment, drug resistance frequently emerges, thereby substantially influencing the effectiveness of HER2-targeted therapy. This article comprehensively summarizes and deliberates upon the strategies of HER2-targeted therapy as well as the underlying resistance mechanisms.

Model-based analysis of a hydrophobic interaction chromatography for antibody-drug conjugate purification.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of biopharmaceutical drugs designed as a targeted therapy for treating cancer while sparing healthy cells. ADCs are complex molecules composed of an antibody linked to a biologically active cytotoxic drug. The drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), which represents the number of drugs conjugated to an antibody, is an important quality attribute of ADCs. The conjugation process typically yields a complex DAR profile, which requires further purification to remove undesired DAR species. Separation of DAR species post conjugation reaction can be achieved using hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). HIC utilizes the hydrophobicity differences of different drug-loaded ADCs to separate them by reversible interaction between the proteins and the hydrophobic stationary phase. The buffer greatly influences the binding interaction between hydrophobic proteins and a HIC resin, but the process is also sensitive to variations in temperature, resin attributes, and the solid-liquid ratio of the column. A mechanistic model that captures these critical process parameters and material and column properties was established from calibration studies using multiple well-characterized HIC columns and resin lots. This model enabled in-silico characterization of the HIC process and facilitated understanding of unexpected process performance observations. It revealed the importance of controlling resin-specific hydrophobic capacity to minimize the DAR separation variations. It led to identifying an effective process control strategy to ensure a consistent DAR profile.

Broadening the Therapeutic Window of ADCs Using Site-Specific Bioconjugation Showcased by an MMAE-Containing Peptide Linker in a CD79b-Targeting ADC.	The limitations of first-generation antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technologies include suboptimal stability and efficacy, poor safety profiles, and challenging manufacturing processes. In this study, we describe an anti-CD79b-monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) ADC generated using a novel peptide-based linker technology that allows for site-specific linker-payload conjugation to native antibodies in only one step. The ADC comprises native polatuzumab as the targeting antibody and a linker-payload consisting of a RKAA-peptide linker and MMAE. We compared our anti-CD79b-RKAA-MMAE ADC with polatuzumab vedotin (PV), the FDA-approved ADC for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In the clinic, PV shows significant instability in circulation, leading to strong and dose-limiting side effects, including neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy. The anti-CD79b-RKAA-MMAE ADC showed optimal biophysical properties with a well-defined drug-to-antibody ratio of 2. It demonstrated potent cytotoxicity in multiple cancer cell lines and was very stable in mouse, cynomolgus monkey, and human sera. The anti-CD79b-RKAA-MMAE conjugate showed equal antitumor efficacy at half the payload dose compared with PV in different xenograft models. At equal MMAE concentrations, greater tumor growth inhibition and a considerably longer duration of response were observed. Ultimately, the highest nonseverely toxic dose of 30 mg/kg was determined in a 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study in rats, which is a 3-fold higher ADC dose than reported for PV. In summary, the data show that our novel site-specific bioconjugation technology enabled the generation of an anti-CD79b-RKAA-MMAE ADC with highly favorable biophysical properties and a greatly improved therapeutic index by a factor of 4 to 6 compared with PV. The ADC may therefore represent a safe and efficacious alternative for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Fundamental properties and principal areas of focus in antibody-drug conjugates formulation development.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a rapidly expanding class of therapeutics driven by their superior specificity and clinical efficacy. 14 out of 16 commercially approved ADCs are formulated as lyophilized forms because ADC is generally considered to be less stable than unmodified antibody. The formulation development for ADCs, particularly liquid formulation, presents unique challenges due to their intricate structural complexity, physicochemical properties, and degradation pathways. This review provides the first comprehensive analysis of formulation strategies employed in commercial ADCs. Furthermore, this review discusses the key areas of focus for ADCs throughout the formulation development workflow, spanning from the initial formulation development to the final stage of drug product manufacturing. In addition, we identify and analyze the distinctive technical challenges in ADC formulation development compared to unconjugated antibody, while proposing potential solutions to these challenges. Finally, we offer strategic perspectives on future directions in ADC formulation development to advance this promising therapeutic modality.	antibody–drug conjugate; drug product development; drug product manufacturing; formulation; stability

Resistance to antibody-drug conjugates: A review.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are antitumor drugs composed of monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic payload covalently coupled by a linker. Currently, 15 ADCs have been clinically approved worldwide. More than 100 clinical trials at different phases are underway to investigate the newly developed ADCs. ADCs represent one of the fastest growing classes of targeted antitumor drugs in oncology drug development. It takes advantage of the specific targeting of tumor-specific antigen by antibodies to deliver cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs precisely to tumor cells, thereby producing promising antitumor efficacy and favorable adverse effect profiles. However, emergence of drug resistance has severely hindered the clinical efficacy of ADCs. In this review, we introduce the structure and mechanism of ADCs, describe the development of ADCs, summarized the latest research about the mechanisms of ADC resistance, discussed the strategies to overcome ADCs resistance, and predicted biomarkers for treatment response to ADC, aiming to contribute to the development of ADCs in the future.

RNA modifications in the tumor microenvironment: insights into the cancer-immunity cycle and beyond.	The chemical modification of biological molecules is a critical regulatory mechanism for controlling molecular functions. Although research has long focused on DNA and proteins, RNA modifications have recently attracted substantial interest with the advancement in detection technologies. In oncology, many studies have identified dysregulated RNA modifications including m6A, m1A, m5C, m7G, pseudouridylation and A to I editing, leading to disrupted downstream pathways. As the concept of the tumor microenvironment has gained prominence, studies have increasingly examined the role of RNA modifications in this context, focusing on interactions among cancer cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and other components. Here we review the RNA modifications in the tumor microenvironment through the perspective of the Cancer-Immunity Cycle. The extracellular RNA modifications including exosomes and influence of microbiome in RNA modifications are potential research questions. Additionally, RNA modifying enzymes including FTO, ALKBH5, METTL3, PUS7 are under investigation as potential biomarkers and targets for combination with immunotherapies. ADCs and mimetics of modified RNA could be potential novel drugs. This review discusses the regulatory roles of RNA modifications within the tumor microenvironment.

Effects of 52 weeks of precuneus rTMS in Alzheimer's disease patients: a randomized trial.	Personalized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus (PC) is emerging as a new non-invasive therapeutic approach in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we sought to investigate the effects of 52 weeks of rTMS applied over the PC on cognitive functions in patients with mild-to-moderate dementia due to AD. Forty-eight patients with mild-to-moderate dementia due to AD were enrolled for the study. Of those 31 patients were extended to 52 weeks after being included in a 24-week trial (NCT03778151) with the same experimental design. The trial included a 52-week treatment with a 2-week intensive course where rTMS (or sham) was applied over the PC daily (5 times per week, Monday to Friday), followed by a 50-week maintenance phase in which the same stimulation was applied once weekly. Personalization of rTMS treatment was established using neuronavigated TMS in combination with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 52 of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Secondary outcomes included score changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) Among 48 patients randomized (mean age 72.8 years; 56% women), 32 (68%) completed the study. Repetitive TMS of the PC (PC-rTMS) had a significant effect on the primary outcome measure. The estimated mean change in CDR-SB after 52 week was 1.36 for PC-rTMS (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.68, 2.04]) and 2.45 for sham-rTMS group (95%CI [1.85, 3.05]). There were also significant effects for the secondary outcomes ADAS-Cog Fifty-two weeks of PC-rTMS may slow down the impairment of cognitive functions, activities of daily living and behavioral disturbances in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Further multicenter studies are needed to confirm the clinical potential of DMN personalized rTMS. The study was registered on the clinicaltrial.gov website on 07-07-2022 (NCT05454540).

The paper proposes a low-power Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) with dual bypass windows based on non-binary split capacitors. To reduce the power consumption, the bypass windows constituted by the split capacitors can maximize the coverage of biological signals both in the resting state and excited state. When the signal falls within the designated window, unnecessary conversion cycles are skipped. This process is mainly judged and controlled by digital circuits, which is highly robust and does not require calibration. Meanwhile, a low-power dynamic CMOS comparator is proposed, which can effectively reduce the voltage variation of the latch node during the comparator's operation, further reducing power consumption. The proposed SAR ADC, based on a 180nm process, measures a power consumption of 9.68nW at a supply voltage of 0.6V and a sampling rate of 5.21kS/s. The signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and the spur-free dynamic range (SFDR) are measured at 57.51dB and 71.68dB, respectively. It also achieves an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 9.26 bits and a Walden figure-of-merit (FoM) of 2.9 fJ/conv.-step. The proposed SAR ADC is also verified by collected electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The average power consumption for quantifying EMG signals is 7.95 nW, providing an attractive solution for low-power SAR ADCs in biomedical applications.

Due to the rapid emergence of treatment-resistant cancers, there is a growing need to discover new anticancer therapies. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are aimed at solving this problem by specifically targeting and delivering cytotoxic payloads directly to cancer cells, thereby minimizing damage to healthy cells and enhancing treatment efficacy. Therefore, it is highly important to find an effective cytotoxic payload to ensure maximum therapeutic benefit and overcome cancer resistance. To address this challenge, we have developed a multi-stage hybrid virtual screening (VS) approach for payload design. We collected approximately 900 million molecules from databases such as ZINC12, ChEMBL, PubChem, and QM9. Additionally, 220 approved small molecule anticancer drugs were collected. Initially, these molecules were screened based on the Lipinski Rule of Five (RO5) criteria, resulting in 20 million molecules that met the drug-like properties criteria. Subsequently, fragments being key factor in this approach were generated from approved small molecule cancer drugs. This fragment-based screening approach resulted in identifying 6500, 36770, and 150,000 anticancer-like drugs with a similarity threshold greater than 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4. Similarity threshold when increased near to 1 bears better chance of discovering cancer like drugs. Further molecular docking of these anticancer-like drugs with β-tubulin resulted in identifying the top 1000 ranked drugs as microtubule inhibitors. ADMET analysis and synthetic validation followed by cell cytotoxicity further helps in shortlisting the 5 most effective payloads for further confirmation in preclinical setting. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulation was performed to confirm the structural stability and conformational dynamics of the Beta-tubulin-ligand complexes over a 100 ns simulation. In conclusion, this study effectively utilizes extensive compound databases and multi-stage screening methods to identify potent payloads, demonstrating promising advancements in discovering effective anticancer therapies.

Novel Native Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography (nRPLC)/MS for Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) Characterization and Drug-Antibody Ratio (DAR) Assessment.	Characterization of drug-antibody ratio (DAR) species in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is crucial for assessing the developability/manufacturability and downstream development of drug candidates. Although hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) is the gold standard for DAR analysis, elucidating DAR species within each HIC peak has historically been challenging. This is due to the nonvolatility and high ionic strength of conventional buffer systems, which necessitate labor-intensive offline fractionation, followed by MS analysis. To address these challenges, an innovative alternative strategy has been developed that directly couples native reversed-phase liquid chromatography (nRPLC) to high-resolution Orbitrap MS for online native MS analysis (nRPLC-MS). In collaboration with Phenomenex, two types of columns, each with a different hydrophobicity, were developed, allowing for elution with low concentration of MS-friendly salt and organic buffer. LC and MS parameters were optimized to enhance the detection of intact DAR species under high flow rate conditions. To demonstrate the feasibility of the platform for characterizing different types of ADCs, both interchain-linked (heterogeneous DAR of 0 to 8) and site-specific ADCs were evaluated. The method enables the nondenatured separation and simultaneous characterization of different DAR species, and strong correlation was observed between this approach and analysis by HIC. This integrated strategy allows unbiased characterization of DAR species without postcolumn flow splitting or peak fractionation. Furthermore, comparisons with two commonly used methods (native SEC-MS and RPLC-MS) have shown that superior separation in terms of selectivity and resolution is achieved with the nRPLC method. Notably, unconjugated antibody (DAR0) was successfully retained with a low-ionic-strength salt using this method. Moreover, the method facilitated the chromatographic separation of positional isomers of DAR4 species with different conjugation linkages, which was not achievable with traditional HIC. As a result, this method holds great promise for high-throughput screening and characterization of ADCs across conjugation methods and payload classes.

Treatment of advanced‑stage non‑small cell lung cancer: Current progress and a glimpse into the future (Review).	Before the twentieth century, patients with advanced lung cancer had limited treatment options and chemotherapy was the primary form of treatment, with an overall survival often <0.5 years. However, with advances in society and medical technology, the treatment approaches for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have markedly changed. Traditional chemotherapy has been gradually replaced by targeted therapy and immunotherapy, leading to the emergence of various new therapeutic options that offer patients more personalized and precise care. This raises the question of what the future holds for the treatment of NSCLC. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest breakthroughs in targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and drugs for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), highlights advances in multimodal combination therapy strategies, and explores the causes of resistance and the challenges that exist in overcoming it. In particular, this review provides unique insights into key directions for future research in NSCLC, such as personalised treatment strategies and biomarker exploration based on multi-omics data, aiming to provide new inspiration for clinical decision-making and research.

Advances in adoptive cell therapies in small cell lung cancer.	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive tumor characterized by early metastasis and resistance to treatment, making it a prime target for therapeutic investigation. The current standard of care for frontline treatment involves a combination of chemotherapeutic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), though durability of response remains limited. The genetic heterogeneity of SCLC also complicates the development of new therapeutic options. Adoptive cell therapies show promise by targeting specific mutations in order to increase efficacy and minimize toxicity. There has been significant investigation in three therapeutic classes for application towards SCLC: antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies. This review summarizes the recent advances and challenges in the development of adoptive cell therapies. Genetic targets such as delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2), B7-H3 (CD276), gangliosides disialoganglioside GD2 (GD2) and ganglioside GM2 (GM2) have been found to be expressed in SCLC, which makes them prime targets for therapy development. While investigated therapies such as rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) have failed, several insights from these trials have led to the development of compelling new agents such as sacituzumab govitecan (SG), ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd), tarlatamab, and DLL3-targeted CAR-T cells. Advancing development of molecular testing and improving targeted approaches remain integral to pushing forward the progress of adoptive cell therapies in SCLC.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising class of anti-cancer therapy with an increasingly critical role in treating various tumors. They broaden the range of therapeutic targets, enabling the consideration of tumor-associated proteins that are overexpressed but lack well-defined mechanisms. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) is a clinically relevant screening marker due to its tumor-specific overexpression, making it an attractive target for ADC development. However, the therapeutic potential of earlier anti-CEACAM5 ADCs has been limited by side effects and suboptimal drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs), restricting their clinical utility. In this study, we developed a novel anti-CEACAM5 ADC (named Actuximab-MMAE), characterized by high affinity, an optimized DAR, and potent tumor-selective cytotoxicity. Actuximab-MMAE demonstrated rapid and effective elimination of CEACAM5-positive tumors in vivo at low doses, while maintaining a favorable safety profile. These findings highlight Actuximab-MMAE as a promising therapeutic option for CEACAM5-overexpressing tumors, offering a new therapeutic method for targeted cancer therapy.

Pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of antibody-drug conjugates, where do we stand?	"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a rising therapeutic class in oncology and hematology, with eleven drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as of January 2025. These ""magic bullets"" have a complex structure, including a monoclonal antibody, a linker, attachment sites, and a payload usually disrupting microtubules, targeting DNA, or inhibiting topoisomerase 1. By targeting specific tumor antigens, they are expected to be exquisitely effective in releasing ""supertoxic"" payloads inside tumor cells after intracellular trafficking. Additionally, they may exert a bystander effect, wherein the released payloads act on neighboring cells, amplifying their therapeutic impact regardless of target expression. ADCs have been game-changing drugs to treat tumors with once dismal prognoses or with previously considered unactionable targets, such as HER2-low or triple-negative breast cancer. To what extent there is room for personalized medicine to improve the toxicity/efficacy ratio remains unknown. However, there are inherent issues related to the complexity of the pharmacokinetics of ADCs and their assessments: efficacy or toxicity may be influenced by the clearance of the intact ADC, the circulating payload, or the payload-linker complex. Deciphering these multifaceted exposure-outcomes relationships for both efficacy and safety endpoints, is critical for advancing precision medicine and enabling personalized dosing strategies. To improve future developments and broaden their therapeutic scope, several strategies can be developed, including developing adequate combinations with other treatment classes (cytotoxic agents, immune-checkpoint inhibitors, oral molecular-targeted therapies). In this review, we will discuss the PK/PD aspects of ADCs and their dosing to improve their use in current and future indications."

Differentiating high-grade patterns and predominant subtypes for IASLC grading in invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma using radiomics and clinical-semantic features.	The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) grading system for invasive non-mucinous adenocarcinoma (ADC) incorporates high-grade patterns (HGP) and predominant subtypes (PS). Following the system, this study aimed to explore the feasibility of predicting HGP and PS for IASLC grading. A total of 529 ADCs from patients who underwent radical surgical resection were randomly divided into training and validation datasets in a 7:3 ratio. A two-step model consisting of two submodels was developed for IASLC grading. One submodel assessed whether the HGP exceeded 20% for ADCs, whereas the other distinguished between lepidic and acinar/papillary PS. The predictions from both submodels determined the final IASLC grades. Two variants of this model using either radiomic or clinical-semantic features were created. Additionally, one-step models that directly assessed IASLC grades using clinical-semantic or radiomic features were developed for comparison. The area under the curve (AUC) was used for model evaluation. The two-step radiomic model achieved the highest AUC values of 0.95, 0.85, 0.96 for grades 1, 2, 3 among models. The two-step models outperformed the one-step models in predicting grades 2 and 3, with AUCs of 0.89 and 0.96 vs. 0.53 and 0.81 for radiomics, and 0.68 and 0.77 vs. 0.44 and 0.63 for clinical-semantics (p < 0.001). Radiomics models showed better AUCs than clinical-semantic models for grade 3 regardless of model steps. Predicting HGP and PS using radiomics can achieve accurate IASLC grading in ADCs. Such a two-step radiomics model may provide precise preoperative diagnosis, thereby supporting treatment planning.	Adenocarcinoma of lung; Computed tomography; IASLC grading; Pathology; Radiomics

Antibody-drug conjugates and radioconjugates targeting carbonic anhydrase IX and XII in hypoxic tumors: Bench to clinical applications.	Treating hypoxic tumors is challenging due to their aggressive nature, resistance to standard treatments, often leading to poor outcomes. Hypoxic tumors create a unique environment that reduces the effectiveness of traditional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Human carbonic anhydrases (hCA IX and hCA XII) are involved in tumors survival and metabolism by regulating pH homeostasis, ferroptosis, metastatization, and other processes. Developing drugs that specifically target these enzymes has been demonstrated to disrupt the tumor survival mechanisms, leading to significant antitumor effects. This review discusses recent developments on antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and radioconjugates targeting hCA IX and hCA XII in hypoxic tumors. New approaches based on small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies such as girentuximab provided encouraging results in preclinical research and clinical trials. These advances highlight the potential of hCA-targeted therapies to improve cancer treatment for hypoxic tumors.

Real-time imaging of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) offers valuable insights for assessing tumor targeting specificity, monitoring therapeutic efficacy, and detecting off-target accumulation that may cause adverse effects. To enable precise tracking, we developed a versatile fluorescent platform based on an NIR-II emitting aza-BODIPY dye, which can be site-specifically grafted onto an IgG1 antibody to generate well-defined fluorescent ADCs. As a proof of concept, we synthesized an HER2-targeting trastuzumab immunoconjugate bearing a NIR-II aza-BODIPY fluorophore. The cytotoxic monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload was introduced in the final step, resulting in a trackable and homogeneous ADC suitable for both in vitro and in vivo investigations. The resulting Trastu-azaNIRII-MMAE selectively accumulated in HER2-positive subcutaneous tumors, significantly reducing the tumor growth. Using NIR-II optical imaging, a single injection of the NIR-II-ADC allowed for the detection of the conjugate over a period of more than one month, highlighting its potential for long-term tracking and therapeutic applications.

Toxicities and management strategies of emerging antibody-drug conjugates in breast cancer.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) offer a promising therapeutic approach for various cancers, enhancing the therapeutic window while mitigating systemic adverse effects on healthy tissues. ADCs have achieved remarkable clinical success, particularly in treating breast cancer, becoming a standard therapy across all subtypes, including hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive, and triple-negative breast cancer. Although designed to selectively target antigens via monoclonal antibodies, ADCs can exhibit toxicity in normal tissues, often due to off-target effects of their cytotoxic payloads. Understanding and managing these toxicities according to established guidelines are crucial for enhancing ADC clinical efficacy, minimizing adverse events, and ultimately improving patient outcomes. This review comprehensively examines the toxicities of ADCs employed in breast cancer treatment and explores their management strategies. Furthermore, we investigate novel ADCs beyond trastuzumab deruxtecan and sacituzumab govitecan, evaluating their potential efficacy and corresponding safety profiles. Understanding antibody-drug conjugate side effects and management in breast cancer Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) offer a promising therapeutic approach for cancer, especially breast cancer. These therapies utilize antibody targeting to deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells. This approach facilitates more precise treatment, minimizing damage to healthy cells and optimizing the balance between efficacy and adverse effects. ADCs are now frequently utilized across all breast cancer subtypes, including hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive, and triple-negative. Despite their targeted design, ADCs can cause side effects because their cytotoxic payloads may also affect healthy cells. These adverse effects vary depending on the specific ADC and may include damage to healthy tissue. Effective management of these toxicities is crucial for maximizing patient benefit from ADCs while mitigating risks. This review describes the management of adverse effects associated with ADCs commonly used in breast cancer treatment.	adverse events; antibody–drug conjugates; breast cancer; trastuzumab deruxtecan

Direct Preparation of Site-Specific Antibody-Drug Conjugates with Unpurified Antibodies in Culture Medium.	In comparison with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been extensively employed in cancer therapy due to their high selectivity and low systemic toxicity. However, the structural complexity of ADCs makes its preparation process more intricate and time-consuming. Conventional ADC production involves multistep purification processes, which significantly increase the costs. Herein, an approach for the direct preparation of site-specific ADCs in an antibody expression system that is derived from the reported K248 site-specific modification technology is demonstrated. This strategy requires only a single purification step to obtain site-specific ADCs, thereby greatly shortening the preparation cycle of ADCs. The preparation of site-specific ADCs in the expression system of Sacituzumab is successfully achieved. The resulting ADCs exhibited comparable physicochemical properties and activities to those obtained through the conventional two-step purification strategy. The approach demonstrates high compatibility with various linkers and antibodies, offering a streamlined methodology for the preparation of site-specific ADCs.

FOLR1 as a therapeutic target in platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma: unique expression patterns across ovarian carcinoma histotypes and molecular subtypes of low-grade serous carcinoma.	With the development of novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), folate receptor alpha (FOLR1) is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of platinum-resistant tubo-ovarian carcinomas. The main aims of this study were to assess FOLR1 protein expression in a large cohort of ovarian carcinoma histotypes. To inform future clinical trial design we identified molecular correlates of FOLR1 expression in low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC). One thousand five hundred forty-seven ovarian carcinoma samples from 5 different Canadian cohorts were successfully evaluated by immunohistochemistry for FOLR1 expression using the PS2+ system. Statistical analyses with clinicopathological parameters, LGSC molecular subtypes, and overall survival (OS) were performed. High FOLR1 expression was detected in 44% of high-grade serous carcinomas, and in 30% LGSC, 8% clear cell, 6% endometrioid, and 0% mucinous and/or mesonephric-type adenocarcinomas. In 160 LGSC cases, FOLR1 expression was more frequent in cases with normal MAPK pathway status (37% MAPK wild type vs. 14% canonical MAPK pathway mutations; p=0.002), low progesterone receptor (PR) expression (41%) vs. 23% (Allred score >2; p A significant proportion of LGSC express high FOLR1 levels supporting the development of clinical trials to investigate ADCs targeting FOLR1 as novel agents for treating this disease. In LGSC, high FOLR1 expression was associated with fewer MAPK pathway alterations, low PR expression, and p16 loss.

Camptothein-Based Anti-Cancer Therapies and Strategies to Improve Their Therapeutic Index.	Camptothecin and its derivatives (CPTs) are potent antineoplastic agents that exert their effects by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase I, leading to apoptosis during cell proliferation. Since their discovery in the 1960s, CPTs have faced challenges such as low water solubility, pH-dependent lactone ring instability, and severe off-target toxicities. Despite extensive research, only two CPTs, irinotecan and topotecan, have received health authority approval. Ongoing clinical trials continue to explore the use of CPTs in combination with targeted therapies and immunotherapies to expand their clinical use. Drug delivery systems, including liposomes and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), have significantly enhanced the therapeutic index of CPTs.

Opportunities and Challenges in Antibody-Drug Conjugates for Cancer Therapy: A New Era for Cancer Treatment.	"The antibody, linker, and payload moieties all play a significant role in giving the ADC its unique therapeutic potential. The antibody subclass employed in ADCs is determined based on relative individual receptor affinities and pharmacokinetics. Meanwhile, the linker used in an ADC can either be cleavable or non-cleavable. ADC therapy comprises antibody-dependent mechanisms in addition to the direct cytotoxic effects of the payload. These include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, as well as the ""bystander effect"", which refers to the diffusion of a portion of the cytotoxic molecules out of the target cell, exerting its cytotoxic effect on the adjacent cells. Target antigens of ADCs are expected to be expressed on the membranes of the cancer cells facing the external matrix, although new approaches utilize antigens regarding tumor-associated cells, the tumor microenvironment, or the tumor vasculature. These target antigens of ADCs not only determine the efficacy of these agents but also impact the off-targets and related adverse effects. The majority of ADC-related toxicities are associated with off-targets. The proposed mechanisms of ADC resistance include disrupted intracellular drug trafficking, dysfunctional lysosomal processing, and the efflux of the cytotoxic molecule via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The latter mechanism is especially prominent for multi-drug-resistant tumors. An important limitation of ADCs is the penetration of the conjugate into the tumor microenvironment and their delivery to target cancer cells. Cancerous tissues' vascular profile and the steric ""binding site barrier"" formed around the peripheral vessels of tumors stand as potential challenges of ADC therapy for solid tumors.

The incidence of mortality and morbidity from endometrial cancer (EC) is increasing annually, and there is a paucity of effective targeted therapies for the condition. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising approach to tumor-targeted therapy. In this study, we aim to identify a novel molecular target for the preclinical development of EC-targeted ADCs. Through quantitative and unbiased bioinformatics analyses intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) was identified as a potential cell membrane target. Two ADCs, ICAM1-MMAE and ICAM1-DXd, were subsequently developed by conjugating ICAM1 monoclonal antibodies with microtubule inhibitors and DNA topoisomerase inhibitors, respectively. The preclinical efficacy and biosafety of these ICAM1 ADCs were validated in both in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis was conducted to elucidate the therapeutic effects of the ICAM1 ADCs. Quantitative flow screening and bioinformatics analyses revealed significant overexpression of ICAM1 in EC. ICAM1-MMAE and ICAM1-DXd were developed using clinically effective linkers and payloads. In preclinical models, ICAM1 ADCs showed superior antitumor efficacy compared to standard chemotherapy, achieving sustained tumor regression with an excellent safety profile in both subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed that ICAM1-DXd potently activated tumor immunity. ICAM1 was identified as a promising cell membrane protein target for ADC development in EC. As-synthesized ICAM1 ADCs demonstrated potent antitumor activity, favorable biosafety profiles in vitro and in vivo, and the ability to activate tumor immunity. These findings support the potential of ICAM1 ADCs as a therapeutic strategy and warrant further investigation in clinical studies.

Recent advances in therapeutic strategies for non-small cell lung cancer.	The development of targeted therapy with small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy with immune checkpoints inhibitors has ushered in the era of precision medicine in treating lung cancer, which remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Both targeted therapy and immunotherapy have significantly improved the survival of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, recent groundbreaking studies have demonstrated their efficacy in both the perioperative setting and following concurrent chemoradiotherapy in early-stage NSCLC. Despite significant advancements in first-line treatment options, disease progression remains inevitable for most patients with advanced NSCLC, necessitating the exploration and optimization of subsequent therapeutic strategies. Emerging novel agents are expanding treatment options in the first-line setting and beyond. Recently, emerging bispecific antibodies have shown enhanced efficacy. For instance, amivantamab has been approved as a treatment for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant NSCLC, including those with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Additionally, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), including HER2-targeting trastuzumab deruxtecan, TROP2-targeting ADCs, HER3-targeting patritumab deruxtecan, and MET-targeting telisotuzumab vedotin, have demonstrated promising outcomes in several clinical trials. This review summarizes the recent advancements and challenges associated with the evolving NSCLC therapeutic landscape.

Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study	ADCS		Hilser Thomas; Darr Christopher; Bedke Jens; Ivanyi Philipp; Klümper Niklas; Eckstein Markus; Schlack Katrin; Grünwald Viktor		Treatment of advanced or metastatic Urothelial Cancer.	Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a significant global health burden and shows consistent increase in incidence. The treatment landscape for advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) has evolved, but significant challenges remain to prolong survival. The article is based on the content of the recent guidelines and a selective literature search. For many years in the past, cisplatin-based chemotherapy was the standard first-line therapy for eligible patients. But chemotherapy alone provides limited long-term benefit, and a large proportion of patients either progress rapidly or are ineligible for cisplatin due to comorbidities. This demonstrates the medical need and led to the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and antibody drug conjugates (ADC) in the field of mUC treatment. More recently, the introduction of ADCs further enlarged the medical armentarium in mUC patients and was further explored as combined regimens. The combination of enfortumab vedotin (EV) and pembrolizumab was superior to standard platin-based chemotherapy as did nivolumab plus gemcitabine with cisplatin, which permanently transformed the medical treatment landscape in mUC. Today, EV plus pembrolizumab is the first line standard in treatment of therapeutic advanced or mUC. New options are also emerging, such as molecular therapies that target the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). In the future, targeted therapy could also be used in the perioperative area. The advent of ICI therapies marked a milestone in medical treatment, which improved survival in UC patients. EV combined with pembrolizumab has fundamentally changed the medical treatment of this disease. This novel therapy in combination with molecular therapies, novel devices and molecular markers offers a great opportunity for the next step in medical development in localized UC and its clinical applicability is being investigated in ongoing studies Key message: Today, EV combined with pembrolizumab sets a new standard of care in medical treatment of a/mUC patients. Compared to platinum-based therapy, EV-P doubled the overall survival probability and reported a median OS of 31.5 months, which is a new hallmark of palliative medical treatment in this disease.

With significant overall survival benefits reported in several phase 3 randomized clinical trials, the integration of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy with systemic chemotherapy has transformed the therapeutic landscape in advanced endometrial cancer and PD-L1+ recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer. For patients with FIGO stage III-IVA locally advanced cervical cancer, irrespective of PD-L1 status, chemoradiation plus pembrolizumab followed by maintenance pembrolizumab also confers a survival benefit. For newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer responding to primary systemic chemotherapy, maintenance therapy using PARP inhibitors and/or bevacizumab according to germline and somatic mutational analysis have been demonstrated to improve progression-free survival. Tumor heterogeneity, acquired drug resistance, and adverse events limit long-term effectiveness. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent an innovative new class of medicines with activity in gynecologic malignancies and distinct toxicity profiles attributable to ADC construction. Adverse event mitigation strategies, biomarker discovery, and sequencing are paramount in successfully exploiting the therapeutic window provided by these novel compounds. This review discusses the application of ADCs in gynecologic cancers, including the current FDA-approved drugs mirvetuximab soravtansine, tisotumab vedotin, and trastuzumab deruxtecan, as well as relevant ongoing clinical trials, including TROP2 ADCs.

Comparison of HER2 Scoring Systems in Endometrial Cancer: Toward Optimization of HER2-Directed Therapies.	Endometrial carcinomas (EC) show variable HER2 protein expression or gene amplification and may be eligible for HER2-directed therapy (trastuzumab or antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) such as trastuzumab-deruxtecan). HER2 testing is currently recommended in advanced-stage/recurrent serous carcinomas and carcinosarcomas. However, no universally adopted reporting guidelines exist, and institutional practices vary. We aimed to analyze our experience with HER2 testing and compare gynecologic (GyC), gastric (GaC), and breast (BrC) criteria. We identified ECs with available HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) results where applicable. HER2 IHC was reassessed using GyC, GaC, and BrC. The overall HER2-positivity rates were 31% by GyC and BrC, and 35.7% by GaC. The scoring systems significantly differed, with 69.8% concordance between GaC and GyC (P<0.001) and 99.2% concordance between BrC and GyC. Our results emphasize the importance of using the appropriate HER2 scoring criteria depending on the type of intended HER2-directed therapy as well as comprehensive yet perspicuous reporting of HER2 status to ensure optimal clinical outcomes in EC patients.

Escitalopram for agitation in Alzheimer's dementia: a randomized controlled phase 3 trial.	Citalopram is effective in treating agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AD), but it is associated with cognitive and cardiac risks, likely due to its R-enantiomer. Escitalopram, the S-enantiomer, may be an alternative. In this double-masked randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in treating agitation in AD after failure of a psychosocial intervention (PSI). Assessments occurred at enrollment, post-PSI (baseline) and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks post-baseline. Settings were 27 community-based centers. The target randomization sample was 392 participants. Participants were adults with AD, a Mini-Mental State Examination Telephone score of 3-20 and significant agitation. PSI non-responders received escitalopram (up to 15 mg per day) or placebo for 12 weeks while continuing PSI. The outcome was the proportion of participants with clinically significant improvement in agitation from baseline at 12 weeks. In total, 173 participants were randomized (84 escitalopram versus 89 placebo; mean ± s.d. age = 78.4 ± 8.7 years; 90 men (52.0%); 127 White (73.4%)). The unadjusted risk difference at 12 weeks was 0.08 (95% confidence interval: -0.21, 0.06). Drug-related QT interval prolongation was observed. Although the randomized sample was smaller than planned, escitalopram was not effective in treating agitation in AD and was associated with cardiac conduction delays. Clinicians need to be cautious in recommending escitalopram as an alternative to citalopram for this condition. ClincialTrials.gov identifier: NCT03108846 .

Hcheng@montefiore.org.	Update 2025: Management of Non‑Small-Cell Lung Cancer.	Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Since 2024, the non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) landscape has undergone a transformative shift, driven by 11 FDA approvals. Recent advances in molecular profiling, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies have revolutionized NSCLC management, ushering in an era of personalized treatment with improved patient outcomes. The increased adoption of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for screening has enhanced early detection, enabling intervention at more curable stages. Molecular diagnostics now play a pivotal role in guiding treatment strategies, with actionable genomic alterations (AGAs) informing the use of EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, NRG1, and other targeted inhibitors in both early and advanced settings. For instance, targeted therapies are increasingly being integrated into early-stage management, with adjuvant osimertinib for EGFR-mutated NSCLC and alectinib for ALK-positive NSCLC demonstrating substantial survival benefits. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, has become a cornerstone of treatment for AGA-negative NSCLC, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, and is increasingly being utilized in the perioperative setting. Furthermore, emerging therapies such as bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and novel immunotherapeutic agents show promise in addressing resistance mechanisms and improving outcomes in advanced-stage disease. Although new challenges arise, the evolving NSCLC treatment paradigm continues to prioritize precision medicine, offering hope for prolonged survival and enhanced quality of life for patients.

A novel pN stage prediction model for resectable rectal adenocarcinoma based on preoperative MRI features and multiregional apparent diffusion coefficients.	To develop and validate a novel model based on preoperative MRI features and multiregional apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) to improve the prediction of pN stage in resectable rectal adenocarcinoma (RA). Two hundred fifty-four consecutive patients (median age [interquartile range], 67 [56-74] years; 156 males) with resectable RA were retrospectively collected at two medical centers from January 2017 to December 2023 and were divided into the training (n = 139), internal validation (n = 60), and external validation (n = 55) sets. All patients underwent preoperative MRI scans. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted on the MRI features and multiregional (RA, peritumoral tissue, and tumor-adjacent rectal wall) ADCs to construct a nomogram model for preoperative predicting pN stage in the training set. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the nomogram model vs the conventional MRI-assessed N (mriN) stage. The ROC curves were compared using the DeLong test. The predictors incorporated in the nomogram model comprised gross tumor volume, categories of short diameter of maximum node, extramural vascular invasion, mesorectal fascia involvement, and ADCs of RA and peritumoral tissue. This model yielded a better prediction of the pN stage compared to the mriN stage in training (AUC, 0.848 vs 0.672; p < 0.001), internal validation (AUC, 0.843 vs 0.699; p = 0.008), and external validation (AUC, 0.857 vs 0.723; p = 0.01) sets. This novel model based on the preoperative MRI features and multiregional ADCs can improve the prediction of the pN stage in RA. Question Accurate preoperative assessment of the pN stage is important for determining an appropriate therapeutic strategy in rectal cancer, but the conventional mriN stage has low sensitivity. Findings Utilization of certain MRI features and multiregional ADCs improves preoperative assessment of the pN stage in RA when compared with conventional MRI assessment. Clinical relevance The novel model, based on preoperative MRI features and multiregional ADC values, can improve the prediction of the pN stage compared to the mriN stage in RA. The combination of this model with the mriN stage helps personalize treatment plans to improve patient prognosis.	Lymph nodes; Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; Nomograms; Rectal neoplasms

Photocatalyzed elaboration of antibody-based bioconjugates.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising class of targeted therapeutics, combining the specificity of antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic drugs to enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing off-target effects. The development of new chemical methods for bioconjugation is essential to generate ADCs and to optimize their stability, efficacy, and safety. Traditional conjugation methods often face challenges related to site-selectivity and heterogeneous product mixtures, highlighting the need to develop new, innovative chemical strategies. Photoredox chemistry emerges as a powerful tool in this context, enabling precise, mild, and selective modifications of peptides and proteins. By harnessing light to drive chemical transformations, photoredox techniques can facilitate the synthesis of antibody bioconjugates. This perspective will discuss the drive to develop and empower photoredox methods applied to antibody functionalization.	antibodies; bioconjugation; bioorthogonality; chemoselectivity; late-stage functionalization; photochemistry

Antibody conjugates in neuroblastoma: a step forward in precision medicine.	Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric cancer that often manifests in a high-risk form and is characterized by frequent relapses and resistance to conventional therapies. This underscores the urgent need for more effective and targeted treatment strategies. One promising avenue has been the identification of unique or overexpressed surface antigens on neoplastic cells, which has facilitated the development of antibody conjugates and related technologies. These include antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and immunotoxins (ITs), which deliver cytotoxic agents directly to tumor cells, as well as antibody-fluorophore conjugates (AFCs), which bind to surface antigens with high specificity to target malignant tumors. Additionally, radioimmunotherapy (RIT) allows the precise delivery of radioactive isotopes linked to a monoclonal antibody directly to the tumor cells. ADCs, ITs, and RIT represent a novel class of anti-cancer agents offering precision therapy with reduced systemic toxicity, enabling longer and potentially more effective treatment regimens. Meanwhile, AFCs are valuable tools in diagnostics, aiding in detecting and characterizing malignant tissues. Despite advancements in antibody conjugates for NB, significant challenges persist, including optimizing payload delivery, mitigating off-target effects, and addressing tumor heterogeneity. Future research should also prioritize refining and integrating these technologies into multimodal treatment protocols to improve outcomes for pediatric NB patients.	antibody-drug conjugates; antibody-fluorophore conjugates; immunotoxin; neuroblastoma; precision medicine; radioimmunotherapy

Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (MIRV) is a FOLR1-binding antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with a microtubule inhibitor payload. We investigated MIRV's efficacy, toxicity profile, and determinants of resistance in a cohort of patients with recurrent/persistent high FOLR1-expressing high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). This retrospective study included 170 patients with recurrent/persistent FOLR1-high (≥75 % of tumor cells with ≥2+ membranous staining intensity) HGSOC who received standard-of-care MIRV monotherapy. We evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. We classified adverse events using CTCAE v5.0. Overall, median PFS was 3.5 months (95 % CI, 3.0-4.1). However, 22.4 % had PFS ≥6 months and were less likely to have progressed on or within one month of prior taxane-based therapy (P = 0.008). Patients with previous progression on a taxane had worse PFS (HR, 1.69; 95 % CI, 1.19-2.40; P = 0.003) and OS (HR, 2.34; 95 % CI, 1.45-3.77; adjusted P = 0.0005). FOLR1 expression was lower in post-MIRV samples (n = 12; P = 0.005). New or worsening neuropathy was observed in 37.6 % of patients. Among the 34.1 % who experienced ocular toxicity, median onset was 42.5 days. Treatment was discontinued in 5.3 % of patients due to toxicity. MIRV confers meaningful PFS benefit for a subset of individuals with HGSOC. Resistance may be associated with decreased FOLR1 target expression or payload resistance. FOLR1-targeted ADCs with a different payload should be evaluated for patients who progress on MIRV but retain high tumor FOLR1 expression.

A bispecific anti-MUC16/anti-death receptor 5 antibody achieves effective and tumor-selective death receptor 5-mediated tumor regression.	The bispecific antibody IMV-M was designed to selectively bind and cluster death receptor 5 (DR5) upon engaging the tumor antigen MUC16 through a novel mechanism-clustering multiple IMV-M molecules on a single MUC16 molecule. IMV-M demonstrated potent, MUC16-selective anti-tumor activity in vitro and in xenograft models without requiring secondary crosslinking, and a pilot non-human primate toxicity study detected no toxicity. Our findings suggest that antibody clustering effectively induces DR5 clustering, resulting in anti-tumor activity. Unlike anti-MUC16 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which rely on cytotoxic payloads, this approach offers a safer and more effective therapeutic strategy. Notably, MUC16 is overexpressed in substantial subsets of ovarian, pancreatic, and lung cancers, with minimal expression in normal tissues, suggesting the broad applicability of this bispecific antibody.

A Facile Method for Gel Electrophoresis with Intrinsic Fluorescence Imaging for Self-Aggregation and Stability Assay of Monoclonal Antibody.	Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are widely used in tumor and autoimmune disease therapy and clinical diagnosis, but they suffer from self-aggregation, particularly dimer formation, impacting their stability, efficacy, and potentially causing severe allergies. Traditional methods for detecting mAb dimers, such as TEM, AUC, DLS, SEC, and CE, are limited by low throughput, high costs, and qualitative data, making them unsuitable for large-scale sample assays in biopharmaceuticals industry as well as antibody research. To address these issues, we developed a facile method of protein cross-linking gel electrophoresis with online intrinsic fluorescence imaging (PC-GE-IFI) for self-aggregation and stability assays of mAbs. This method enables the real-time quantification of monoclonal antibody (mAb) monomers and dimers with exceptional sensitivity, characterized by low detection limits (monomer: 0.9 nM; dimer: 0.45 nM) and a broad dynamic range (monomer: 2.50-2500 nM; dimer: 1.25-1250 nM). Furthermore, the sample wells can be used as windows for the assay of precipitates formed by mAb aggregation. The method supports accurate assessment of mAb dimerization and monomer purity under various stress conditions, including thermal stress, mechanical agitation, and freeze-thaw cycles. Moreover, the method allows concurrent analysis of dimers and precipitates across multiple samples at different concentrations, while nonlinear fitting provides the dissociation constant (

Nomograms Integrating MRI-derived Apparent Diffusion Coefficient and Clinicopathologic Features for Prediction of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer.	Purpose To develop three nomograms integrating apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) derived from diffusion-weighted imaging to predict the status of pretreatment axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) (task 1), nonsentinel lymph nodes (task 2), and ALNs after neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment (task 3) in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods Pretreatment MRI scans, including diffusion-weighted images, were retrospectively acquired from patients with breast cancer at multiple centers from May 2019 to May 2023. ADC values and clinicopathologic features were measured. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of ALN metastasis. These predictors were incorporated into nomogram models for each of the three tasks. Model performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis in training and two external testing datasets. Results The study included 961 female patients (mean age ± SD, 50 years ± 10) with breast cancer from three hospitals. In the three tasks, the ADC values of the ALN metastasis groups were lower than those of the nonmetastasis groups (all	Apparent Diffusion Coefficient; Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis; Breast; MR-Diffusion Weighted Imaging; MR-Functional Imaging; Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy; Nonogram; Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastasis

Second-line antibody-drug conjugates for the treatment of metastatic human papillomavirus-independent gastric-type adenocarcinoma of cervix: The Singapore experience.	Human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAS) is a rare, aggressive, chemoresistant histological subtype of cervical cancer which occurs more commonly in patients of Asian descent. Patients with GAS tend to have poorer overall outcomes compared to HPV-associated adenocarcinomas of the cervix. The antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) tisotumab vedotin-tftv (TV) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) are approved for use in previously treated metastatic cervical cancer, the latter in HER2-expressing tumors. There is paucity of data regarding the efficacy and safety of TV and T-DXd in the management of metastatic GAS. We report outcomes of four patients with metastatic GAS who were treated with these ADCs in the second-line setting in Singapore.	Antibody-drug conjugates; Cervical cancer; Mucinous carcinoma

Antibody-drug conjugates in breast cancer: current evidence and future directions.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a rapidly evolving class of antitumor drugs and have already revolutionized the treatment strategy of many hematologic and solid cancers. So far, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) are the four ADCs that have been approved by US food and drug administration (FDA) in treatment of breast cancer, and SKB264 has been approved by Chinese national medical products administration (NMPA). Many ADCs for treatment of breast cancer are currently being tested in late-phase clinical trials, with several encouraging results achieved recently. However, major issues arise during the use of ADCs, including emergence of acquired resistance, occurrence of treated-related toxicities, and identification of biomarkers of response and resistance. ADCs are being increasingly tested in combination with other agents, and novel next-generation ADC development is progressing rapidly. A better understanding of the design and development of ADCs will promote ADC development for cancer treatment. In this review, we aim to provide a broad overview of the design and the recent advances of ADCs in breast cancer. We also propose several notable future directions of ADCs in treatment of breast cancer.	Antibody-drug conjugate; Biomarker; Breast cancer; Combination therapy; Trials

The BCL2 family: from apoptosis mechanisms to new advances in targeted therapy.	The B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein family critically controls apoptosis by regulating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. In this cutting-edge review, we summarize the basic biology regulating the BCL2 family including canonical and non-canonical functions, and highlight milestones from basic research to clinical applications in cancer and other pathophysiological conditions. We review laboratory and clinical development of BH3-mimetics as well as more recent approaches including proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and tools targeting the BH4 domain of BCL2. The first BCL2-selective BH3-mimetic, venetoclax, showed remarkable efficacy with manageable toxicities and has transformed the treatment of several hematologic malignancies. Following its success, several chemically similar BCL2 inhibitors such as sonrotoclax and lisaftoclax are currently under clinical evaluation, alone and in combination.

Structural Insights into Lipoate Ligase A-Mediated Antibody Modifications.	Enzyme-mediated site-specific protein modification is gaining attention in biopharmaceuticals due to its high specificity and mild conditions. Lipoic acid ligase A (LplA) has been widely studied for conjugating short-chain fatty acids to lysine residues, traditionally using LAP tags. Recent advances have enabled tag-free LplA modifications, expanding applications in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and beyond. This study investigates the selective modification of Lys188 in trastuzumab by LplA. Spatial analysis and molecular modeling suggest that D151 and H189 facilitate nucleophilic attack and stabilize intermediates via electrostatic and π-cation interactions. These insights enhance our understanding of enzyme-driven site selectivity, guiding the rational design of antibody modifications. The findings support broader applications in ADC production, diagnostics, and next-generation biopharmaceuticals, emphasizing the role of local amino acid environments in enzymatic modifications.

Stability of intravenous antibody dilutions in clinical use: Differences across patient populations with varying body weights.	Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) plays a crucial role in the treatment of various diseases and intravenous injection is the primary administration route for ADCs due to its high bioavailability. However, this method requires drug preparation and dilution, which can compromise the stability of the solution and increase the risk of aggregation as excipient concentrations are reduced during dilution. Antibody drug dosing is often based on patient body weight and typically diluted in either 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride or 5% (w/v) dextrose injections. Variations in patient body weight lead to differences in the final concentrations of both the drug and excipients, affecting stability. In this study, we examined the stability of intravenous dilutions for patients with varying body weights using trastuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine ADCs. Analytical techniques including size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), fluid imaging microscopy (FIM), bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, and turbidity testing were employed to assess monomer, oligomer, and aggregate levels before and after dilution. Machine learning was applied to distinguish the morphology of sub-visible particles. Our findings reveal that weight-based dosing leads to significant stability differences in intravenous preparations. This study offers important insights into the formulation stability of biopharmaceuticals and their clinical use.

Advances in antibody-drug conjugates for endometrial cancer.	The treatment of advanced endometrial cancer is clinically challenging, prompting the exploration of innovative therapeutic strategies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADCs, which include monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic components, and linkers, demonstrate robust targeting, cytotoxicity, and manageable adverse effects. To provide a thorough understanding of the status of research, this review elucidates promising therapeutic targets in endometrial cancer, such as HER2, FRα, and TROP-2, and summarizes preclinical and clinical trial data on related ADC drugs in endometrial cancer. We also discuss the toxicity of ADC drugs. Most adverse events arise from cytotoxic components such as microtubule inhibitors and topoisomerase inhibitors. The ocular toxicity may be mainly related to off-target effects of MMAF/DF4 payloads. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a serious adverse event, mainly caused by antibodies, and most of them are grade 1-2 toxicity. Among them, anti-HER2 ADC induced interstitial pneumonia is commonly dose dependent. Moreover, we identified potential new targets for endometrial cancer treatment and explored strategies to overcome ADC resistance, such as choosing combination therapy or developing a new generation of ADC drugs. Continuous research and innovation in this field hold promise for improving the survival and overall quality of life of patients with advanced endometrial cancer.

ICAM-1 Is Overexpressed by Cancers and Negatively Impacts Antibody-Based Therapies Including Antibody-Drug Conjugates.	Humoral immunity utilizes antibodies and immune effector cells to mediate dysregulated cancer cell killing. These mechanisms are referred to as Humoral Immuno-Oncology (HIO). HIO immunosuppression is mediated by tumor-produced proteins called HIO factors. Using a combination of patient serum analysis and literature searches, we screened a number of samples to determine if they suppressed HIO. Herein, we identified that ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) can bind IgG1-type antibodies and suppress their immune effector activity. Through a series of mutagenesis, we identified a unique motif within the IgG1CH3 domain essential for ICAM-1 binding, which inhibits antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Conservative amino acid substitutions within the CH3 domain were able to abrogate ICAM-1 binding and overcome ICAM-1 mediated immune effector suppression. Additionally, isogenic tumor cell lines with silenced ICAM-1 expression were more susceptible to antibody-drug conjugate (ADCs) cytotoxicity than parental cells. This effect appeared to correlate with membrane ICAM-1 binding to the IgG1 component that reduced ADC internalization, a function important for maximal target cell killing. These findings highlight a novel mechanism by which tumors can suppress the host's immune system for survival and offer new concepts for engineering antibody-based therapeutics that are refractory to ICAM-1 immunosuppression.

Antibody-drug conjugates in rare genitourinary tumors: review and perspectives.	Rare cancers of the genitourinary (GU) tract are often clinically aggressive yet have few or no standard-of-care treatments. Multiple antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been approved in solid malignancies. This review explores the use of ADCs in rare GU tumors in the context of biological pathways and ongoing research in solid tumors. Few clinical trials of ADCs focus on recruiting participants with rare tumors of the GU tract, including trials testing enfortumab vedotin as monotherapy or combined with pembrolizumab, and sacituzumab govitecan as monotherapy or combined with atezolizumab. We highlight many ongoing trials of novel ADCs for advanced/metastatic solid tumors and emphasize the potential eligibility of patients with rare GU tumors for tumor-agnostic trials.

Microstructural diffusion MRI for differentiation of breast tumors and prediction of prognostic factors in breast cancer.	This study aims to investigate the feasibility of cellular microstructural mapping by the diffusion MRI (IMPULSED, imaging microstructural parameters using limited spectrally edited diffusion) of breast tumors, and further to evaluate whether the MRI-derived microstructural features is associated with the prognostic factors in breast cancer. This prospective study collected 232 patients with suspected breast tumors from March to August 2023. The IMPULSED MRI scan included acquisitions of diffusion MRI using both pulsed (PGSE) and oscillating (OGSE) gradient spin echo with the oscillating frequencies up to 33 Hz. The OGSE and PGSE data were fitted by the IMPUSLED method using a two-compartment model to estimate mean cell diameter ( 213 patients were finally included and divided into malignant (n=130) and benign (n=83) groups according to the histopathological results. The The IMPULSED method demonstrates promise for characterizing cellular microstructural features in breast tumors, which may be helpful for prognostic risk evaluation in breast cancer.

Establishment and characterization of novel patient-derived esophageal tumoroids with long-term cultivability.	Esophageal cancer is an aggressive and fatal disease classified into two distinct histologic types: esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). To develop novel therapeutic strategies, it is important to establish preclinical models of esophageal carcinoma. In this study, we successfully established three types of human esophageal cancer organoids (tumoroids) from surgical specimens for long-term culture. Two of the tumoroids were derived from ESCC and one from EAC, which arose from Barrett's esophagus. Whole-exome sequencing revealed that the tumoroids inherited genetic mutations from the parental tumors and patient-derived tumor xenografts closely mimicked the pathology of the original esophageal cancers. In addition to whole-exome analysis, copy number and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated HER2 expression and amplification as well as HER3 expression and mutation in esophageal tumoroids derived from adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), and patritumab deruxtecan (P-DXd) effectively suppressed the viability of the tumoroids. Therefore, the establishment of esophageal tumoroids with long-term cultivability makes it possible to obtain reproducible basic data, including drug sensitivity studies, which are important for the development of personalized therapies and treatment strategies.

New anticancer strategies increasingly rely on targeted therapies, which maximize anticancer activity while reducing toxicity to healthy cells. These modern anticancer therapies (MATs) mainly include immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and targeted anticancer therapies (TATs) which inhibit signal transduction pathways. These new molecules are associated with a wide range of ocular adverse events (OAEs), of varying severity: from ocular surface irritation to irreversible vision loss. ICIs can trigger autoimmune responses in all eye tissues. ADCs mainly cause ocular surface toxicity, the most specific of which being microcyst-like epithelial changes (MECs). TATs cause a wide range of OAEs, depending on their class. Oncologists and ophthalmologists will be increasingly confronted to these OAEs - some of which are still poorly characterized - as the number of prescribed NTAs increases. Close collaboration between specialists is essential for their early identification and management, which helps reduce visual and quality of life consequences for these patients. This review addresses the clinical characteristics of the main OAEs linked to MATs, the description of the suspected underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and the key points of their management.

Nausea and vomiting in an evolving anticancer treatment landscape: long-delayed and emetogenic antibody-drug conjugates.	Nausea and vomiting are common, distressing side effects associated with chemotherapeutic regimens, resulting in reduced quality of life and treatment adherence. Appropriate antiemetic prophylaxis strategies may reduce/prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Historically, investigators assessed antiemetics up to 120 hours after chemotherapy. However, CINV can extend beyond this time. Thus, the effect of antiemetics during the long-delayed period (>120 hours) requires investigation. Emerging treatment options, including certain antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), are associated with high rates of acute and late-onset nausea and vomiting that can last for extended duration. With the increasing number of ADCs approved and in development, there is urgency to control nausea and vomiting in patients receiving these new therapies. In this narrative review, we present the emetogenic potential of ADCs and CINV in the long-delayed period along with antiemetic prophylaxis strategies used to date. We also discuss the promising role of the fixed-combination antiemetic NEPA ([fos]netupitant plus palonosetron) in controlling long-delayed nausea and vomiting, addressing characteristics that may contribute to its longer efficacy duration compared to other antiemetics. Finally, we highlight encouraging results with NEPA in patients receiving the ADCs trastuzumab deruxtecan or sacituzumab govitecan, which suggest NEPA may be an effective antiemetic prophylaxis in these settings. Patients with cancer who are treated with chemotherapy often have nausea and vomiting as side effects. These symptoms can be very uncomfortable, negatively impact the quality of life, and may cause patients to stop treatment. Using the right antinausea and vomiting medications can help to reduce symptoms and enable patients to stay on therapy.Many studies have looked at how effective different combinations and doses of these medications are in reducing or preventing nausea and vomiting in the 5 days after chemotherapy treatment. However, it is now clear that nausea and vomiting can last longer than this time period. Newer treatments called antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are being used to treat patients with cancer but may also cause nausea and vomiting after 5 days (known as long-delayed nausea and vomiting). To make sure patients receive the best possible care to prevent these symptoms, it is important to understand how well antinausea and vomiting medications work over longer periods of time.This paper discusses how often this long-delayed nausea and vomiting occurs in patients after they have received chemotherapy or ADCs. We also look at different medications that are being used to prevent nausea and vomiting, including a drug called NEPA (netupitant and palonosetron). NEPA is a combination of two antinausea and vomiting medications. It may be a good option for preventing long-delayed nausea and vomiting, as it is effective over longer time periods than other similar medications. NEPA has shown very promising results in studies so far.	NEPA; Nausea and vomiting; antibody-drug conjugates; antiemetics; long-delayed CINV; netupitant and palonosetron

Automated dispensing cabinets and the effect on omitted doses of ward stock medicines; can implementation reduce delays to first dose antimicrobials?	Omitted doses are a subset of medication administration errors which have the potential to cause severe harm. Sepsis is a clinical condition where dose omissions or delays in medicines administration can be fatal. Automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) provide a medicines management solution which keeps track of stock in real time and can automatically generate orders, reducing the likelihood of medication stockouts. This study aims to assess the impact of ADC implementation on the rate of omitted doses due to unavailability of ward stock medicines. Secondary aims are to investigate the effect of ADCs on omitted doses of first dose antimicrobials. Due doses data was compiled from the electronic prescribing and medicines administration (EPMA) system for ten wards pre-ADC implementation between July and September 2022 and was compared with data post-ADC implementation between July and September 2023. Omitted doses were selected and filtered for those marked 'drug not available'. Ward stock lists were used to determine which omitted doses were for medicines held as ward stock. A secondary analysis filtered this data further to isolate omitted doses of ward stock medicines which were systemically administered antimicrobials. The overall number of prescribed doses during the pre-implementation period was comparable to those in the post-implementation period. There was a total of 393 omitted doses of ward stocked medicines due to unavailability pre-ADC implementation, and 817 post-ADC implementation. This represents an omission rate due to unavailability of ward stock medicines as a percentage of all prescribed doses, of 0.08 % pre-ADC and 0.18 % post-ADC implementation. Statistical analysis showed no difference (	Antimicrobials; Automated dispensing cabinet; Omitted doses; Pharmacy operations

Utilizing machine learning algorithms for predicting Anxiety-Depression Comorbidity Syndrome in Gastroenterology Inpatients (ADCS-GI).	Accurately diagnosing Anxiety-Depression Comorbidity Syndrome in Gastroenterology Inpatients (ADCS-GI) shows significant challenges as traditional diagnostic methods fail to meet expectations due to patient hesitance and non-psychiatric healthcare professionals' limitations. Therefore, the need for objective diagnostics highlights the potential of machine learning in identifying and treating ADCS-GI. A total of 1186 ADCS patients were recruited for this study. We conducted extensive studies for the dataset, including data quantification, equilibrium, and correlation analysis. Eight machine learning models, including Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Neighbors Classifier, RandomForest, XGB, CatBoost, Cascade Forest, and Decision Tree, were utilized to compare prediction efficacy, with an effort to minimize the dependency on subjective questionnaires. Among eight machine learning algorithms, the Decision Tree and K-nearest neighbors models demonstrated an accuracy exceeding 81% and a sensitivity in the same range for detecting ADCS in patients. Notably, when identifying moderate and severe cases, the models achieved an accuracy above 88% and a sensitivity of 90%. Furthermore, the models trained without reliance on subjective questionnaires showed promising performance, indicating the feasibility of developing questionnaire-free early detection applications. Machine learning algorithms can be used to identify ADCS among gastroenterology patients. This can help facilitate the early detection and intervention of psychological disorders in gastroenterology patients' care.

A Stepwise decision tree model for differential diagnosis of Kimura's disease in the head and neck.	This study aims to differentiate Kimura's disease (KD) from Sjogren's syndrome with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (SS&MALT), neurofibromatosis (NF), and lymphoma in the head and neck by using a stepwise decision tree approach. A retrospective analysis of 202 patients with pathologically confirmed KD, SS&MALT, NF, or lymphoma was conducted. Demographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected, with qualitative features (e.g., skin thickening, lesion morphology, lymphadenopathy, MRI signal intensity) and quantitative variables (e.g., age, lesion size, apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs), wash-in rate, time to peak (TTP), time-signal intensity curve (TIC) patterns) examined. A stepwise decision-tree model using the classification and regression trees (CART) algorithm was developed to aid in the differential diagnosis of KD in the head and neck. The model's diagnostic accuracy and misclassification risk were assessed to evaluate its reliability and effectiveness. Key characteristics for KD included male predominance (91.7%), frequent lymphadenopathy (86.1%), and skin thickening (72.2%). Primary lesions of NF typically exhibited higher ADCs compared to those of KD, SS&MALT, and lymphoma. In lymphadenopathy, however, unique ADC patterns were observed: in KD, the ADCs of lymphadenopathy were lower than those of primary lesions, whereas in lymphoma, the ADCs of lymphadenopathy were comparable to those of primary lesions. Predictors for distinguishing KD included lesion's location, ADCs, lymphadenopathy, and sizes (all p < 0.001). The decision-tree model achieved an impressive 99.0% accuracy in the differential diagnosis across the overall cohort, with a 10-fold cross-validated misclassification risk of 0.079 ± 0.024. The stepwise decision tree model, based on MRI features, showed high accuracy in differentiating KD from other head and neck diseases, offering a reliable diagnostic tool in clinical practice. KD is characterized by male predominance, skin thickening, and high incidence of lymphadenopathy. ADCs and TIC patterns are distinguishable in differentiating KD from SS&MALT, NF, and lymphoma in the head and neck. The decision tree model enhances the understanding of KD imaging features and facilitates accurate KD diagnosis, offering an easily accessible and convenient diagnostic tool for radiologists and physicians in daily practice and guiding tailored clinical management plans for affected patients.

Assessment of Hammer Energy Measurement for the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) Using Pile Driving Analyzer and Kallpa Analyzer Devices in Peru.	Energy measurement in dynamic penetration tests is key to correctly interpreting test results and ensuring comparable geotechnical data. Although commercial devices are widely used, their high cost limits adoption in developing regions such as Peru, affecting the accuracy of soil evaluation in many geotechnical studies. In this context, this research presents an energy measurement system called Kallpa, which uses low-cost electronic components to digitize sensor signals during Standard Penetration Tests (SPTs). Kallpa employs high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with an advanced sampling frequency, processing and storing data via a Raspberry Pi 4 microcomputer. The sensors, including accelerometers and strain gauges, were calibrated and compared with the Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) to validate their accuracy in the Kallpa system. This study involved sixteen Standard Penetration Tests (SPTs) conducted in various regions of Peru using donut hammers and two tests involving automatic hammers. The results demonstrate that the Kallpa system is comparable to other energy measurement devices on the market, such as the Dynamic Penetration Test (DPT), which provides accurate SPT energy measurements. The Kallpa Processor (Version 1.0) software was developed to perform data acquisition and calibration, analyzing approximately 500 hammer blows and comparing peak values with those of the Pile Driving Analyzer. The data collected by Kallpa's sensors strongly agreed with the PDA data, validating the reliability of the device. The Energy Transfer Ratio (ETR) for manual hammers ranged from 43.5% to 68.4%, with an average of 58.9%, whereas automatic hammers presented ETR values between 82% and 87%. The correction of the N60 blow count allowed for the estimation of the relative density of soils evaluated at different depths and locations across Peru.

Novel insights into the molecular nature of neurofilament light polypeptide species in cerebrospinal fluid.	The quantification of neurofilament light polypeptide (NFL) in biofluids is being clinically used to detect and grade general neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases and quantify neuronal injury during acute events like traumatic brain injury. Specific assays that target only particular molecular breakdown products of neurofilaments have the potential to distinguish between various pathologies. Nevertheless, the molecular structure of neurofilament light polypeptide in cerebrospinal fluid remains to be elucidated. We characterized neurofilament light polypeptide in cerebrospinal fluid by size-exclusion chromatography, Western blotting and mass spectrometry. Neurofilament light polypeptide in cerebrospinal fluid was found to be composed of aggregates of fragments of the full-length molecule. These aggregates were sensitive to reduction by dithiothreitol and dissociated to monomeric fragments of 6-12 kDa (Western blot), covering most of the coiled-coil domains of neurofilament light polypeptide. Since only cysteine residues can form disulfide bonds, this points to a role of the single cysteine 322 for maintaining the stability of the aggregates. The sequence region covered by the identified fragments ended just a few amino acids C-terminally of the coiled-coil region at a site which had been previously mapped to a calpain cleavage site in the glial fibrillary acidic protein, which is highly homologous to neurofilament light polypeptide in the coiled-coil region. This cleavage site was also confirmed to be present in bovine neurofilament light polypeptide by	NFL; Uman MAb; aggregates; neurofilament light; size exclusion chromatography

Lifetime estrogen exposure and domain-specific cognitive performance: results from the IGNITE study.	Disruptions in estrogen exposure (i.e., surgically induced menopause) have been linked to poorer cognitive aging and dementia risk. Hormone therapy use (e.g., birth control, menopausal hormone therapy) has shown mixed associations with cognitive performance, possibly due to limited cognitive test batteries. To address previous inconsistencies, we investigated baseline data from Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise (IGNITE). We hypothesized that (1) oophorectomy prior to natural menopause would be associated with poorer cognitive performance, (2) timing and duration of birth control and menopausal hormone therapy would influence associations with cognitive performance, and (3) In 461 post-menopausal females (M age = 69.6) we assessed oophorectomy and hormone therapy use to examine associations with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and factor-analytically derived composite scores for episodic memory, processing speed, working memory, executive function/attentional control, and visuospatial processing. Hypothesis (1) We did not observe associations between oophorectomy prior to natural menopause and poorer cognitive performance. However, hormone therapy use, started on average within 2 years of oophorectomy, was associated with better episodic memory (β = 0.106, Our results suggest exposure to estrogen during adulthood, specifically birth control and hormone therapy among women undergoing pre-menopausal oophorectomy, benefits cognitive function in older adulthood.

Late-midlife lifestyle and brain and cognitive changes in individuals on the AD versus non-AD continuum.	We investigated whether a composite measure of late-midlife lifestyle was associated with (1) longitudinal brain changes and (2) cognitive changes when adjusting for these brain changes. We used linear mixed models to examine whether the LIfestyle for BRAin Health (LIBRA) index was associated with changes in tau, white matter hyperintensity, neurodegeneration, and cognition and whether changes were similar in amyloid positive (A+; > 17 Centiloids) and negative participants. We included 324 individuals from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (39% apolipoprotein E [ In the age-range and disease-range studied, lifestyle did not exhibit a meaningful effect on Alzheimer's disease or vascular biomarker accumulation and was not consistently associated with cognitive trajectories. In this age-range, the LIfestyle for BRAin Health (LIBRA) index was not associated with biomarker trajectories.The LIBRA index was not consistently associated with cognitive trajectories.Effects of lifestyle, if any, may take more time to manifest.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy associated with repetitive head impact (RHI) exposure. Genetic variation in the 17q21.31 region, containing microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), has been implicated in tauopathies but has not been investigated in CTE. The region includes a megabase-long inversion (H1/H2) and copy-number variations, including α, β, and γ segments, which can be characterized as nine segregating structural haplotypes. We leveraged array SNP data and a reference panel across the 17q21.31 region to impute structural haplotypes and test their association with CTE endophenotypes in 447 European ancestry brain donors with RHI exposure. The H1β1γ1 haplotype was significantly associated with dementia and semi-quantitative tau burden in multiple cortical and medial temporal regions commonly affected in CTE. H1β1γ1 differential expression analyses in dorsolateral frontal cortex implicated cis-acting genes and inflammatory pathways. Taken together, the H1β1γ1 haplotype may help explain CTE heterogeneity among those with similar RHI exposure.	17q21.31; MAPT; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; dementia; differential gene expression; immune system; repetitive head impacts; structural haplotypes; tauopathy; traumatic brain injury

Feasibility of Telephone-Based Cognitive Assessments and Healthcare Utilization in US Medicare-Enrolled Older Adults Following Emergency Department Discharge.	Wider screening and assessment for Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias (ADRD) may increase access to supportive care, improve allocation of medical care, and foster the use of interventions that prevent or delay disease progression. Yet, the effect of diagnostic timing on clinical and utilization outcomes is poorly understood. Community-based settings such as a hospital emergency department (ED) may be an underrecognized opportunity to assess cognition and impacts on individuals and health systems. This study assessed the feasibility of recruiting older adults for telephone-based trials following presentation to the ED and administering telephone based cognitive assessments over the phone in this population. Medicare-enrolled individuals 65+ years of age (n = 160) presenting to the Oregon Health & Science University Emergency Department (Portland, Oregon) between May 2022 and February 2023 were recruited by telephone. Participants were administered the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) Assessment and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cognitive Measure Questions on Mental Clarity via telephone 1-12 weeks post-discharge to evaluate cognition. Electronic medical records (EMR) were reviewed for medical care utilization including primary care provider (PCP) visits, hospital admissions, and ED visits for the 3 years prior to ED presentation. Twenty-six percent of eligible ED users contacted elected for study enrollment. The TICS Assessment score had a significant relationship with the three evaluated health care utilization measures (ED, PCP visits, or hospitalizations); the PROMIS Assessment had significant but weak correlations to ED and PCP visits. Older adults 65+ years presenting to the ED are amenable to enroll in telephone-based cognition-focused trials and cognitive assessments can be carried out over the telephone in this population. The PROMIS Assessment may be a better cognition assessment tool when evaluating for cognition and care utilization in this population. In addition to the limits of the screening tools used in this study, a lack of a representative sample is a limitation of the study design. Future studies could use other validated cognitive assessment tools and utilize a study design with a recruitment strategy focused on obtaining a representative sample of older ED patients.

Brain-Derived Tau as an Outcome Marker in Guillain-Barré Syndrome: A Retrospective Cohort Study.	Biomarkers for predicting disease severity and outcome in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) are scarce. We aimed to determine if brain-derived tau in serum (sBD-tau) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF BD-tau) are associated with long-term outcome and disease severity in GBS. In this retrospective study of 100 GBS patients, we measured sBD-tau and CSF BD-tau at diagnosis. Outcome was defined as GBS disability scale (GBSDS) > 2 and overall neuropathy limitation scale (ONLS) at 12 months, disease severity as respiratory support and ONLS at nadir. BD-tau levels were compared between groups and correlated with ONLS scores. Regression analyses and receiver operator characteristic curve analyses were performed for GBSDS > 2 at 12 months. BD-tau levels were higher for GBSDS > 2 at 12 months in serum and CSF. Odds ratio for sBD-tau was 1.9 (95% CI 1.08-3.2, p = 0.03) and for CSF BD-tau was 5.9 (95% CI 1.4-25, p = 0.02). Area under curve for sBD-tau was 0.75 (95% CI 0.57-0.9, p < 0.001) and for CSF BD-tau was 0.78 (95% CI 0.65-0.9, p = 0.001). ONLS at 12 months correlated with sBD-tau (ρ = 0.34 [95% CI 0.12-0.53], p = 0.002) and CSF BD-tau (ρ = 0.33 [95% CI 0.08-0.54], p = 0.01). Statistically significant difference in BD-tau levels was not seen for respiratory support or ONLS at nadir. BD-tau at GBS onset is associated with long-term outcome but not disease severity. Because BD-tau is essentially a CNS biomarker, our results suggest that CNS involvement influences recovery.	Guillain‐Barré syndrome; biomarker; prognosis; tau proteins

Perceived social support and relationship quality predict loneliness in older adults: a social network approach.	Loneliness negatively impacts older adults' mental and physical health. Though loneliness is associated with perceived social support, its relationship to received support is unclear. This might be because received support has been defined sparsely, overlooking types of support and overall relationship quality. The current study addressed this gap. Older adults recruited from the community ( In both samples, loneliness was negatively related to perceived social support but was not related to either received support type. Contact frequency predicted loneliness in both samples, but network closeness predicted loneliness in the ADRC sample only. Dementia status did not affect results. Social network size, emotional received support, and instrumental received support were not related to loneliness, but perceived social support and relationship quality were. These findings suggest that loneliness is influenced by perceived social support and some types of received support.

Neocortical tau propagation is a mediator of clinical heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease.	Heterogeneity in progression of clinical dementia obstructs the general therapeutic potential of current treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Though the mechanisms of this heterogeneity remain unclear, the characterization of bioactive tau species and factors that regulate their seeding behavior might give valuable insight as pathological tau is well correlated with cognitive impairment. Here, we conducted an innovative investigation into the molecular basis of widespread, connectivity-based tau propagation that begins in the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and spreads to neocortical areas such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Biochemical analysis of human postmortem ITG and PFC tissues revealed individual variability in tau seeding, which correlated with cognitive decline, particularly in the ITG, a region known for promoting accelerated tau propagation. Notably, this study presents the first evidence that site-specific phosphorylation and isoform composition of both aggregation-prone high-molecular-weight (HMW) tau and the relatively unexplored, yet potentially crucial in AD progression low-molecular-weight (LMW) tau significantly contribute to tau propagation and cognitive decline. Our findings underscore the importance of comprehensively considering diverse tau forms including both HMW and LMW tau species in understanding AD progression. Additionally, these results are the first to identify distinct morphological strains within the AD brain associated with differing seeding propensity, potentially enabling patient stratification based on their tau profile. Furthermore, RNA-seq analyses of gene expression patterns in the ITG revealed molecular heterogeneity associated with tau seeding potential. Patients with higher levels of seed-competent tau displayed greater impairments in synaptic and neural plasticity, and increased neuroinflammation. This multidisciplinary study offers novel insights into various molecular mechanisms driving AD progression, suggesting potential molecular targets for early intervention and improved patient subtyping, which is critical for developing precision medicine approaches.

Psychometrics of the Lifetime Total Physical Activity Questionnaire in adults with a history of depression.	BackgroundDepression earlier in life is a risk factor for dementia later in life. Physical activity is associated with less risk of depression and dementia. However, prevention of Alzheimer's disease may be most effective before the onset of brain pathology, which precedes dementia symptoms by 20 + years, requiring the measure of physical activity across the life course.ObjectiveAssess the reliability and validity of the Lifetime Total Physical Activity Questionnaire (LTPAQ) in community-dwelling cognitively intact adults with and without a history of depression.MethodsTest-retest reliability was assessed with intraclass correlations (ICC).

Multiple brain pathologies accumulate with age, but their underlying biology remains unclear. We investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in ten age-related cerebral pathologies. Using miRNA sequencing profiles from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 617 brain donors, we identified miRNAs associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, Lewy body pathology, arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and LATE-NC after adjusting for age, sex, and education. After additionally adjusting for co-existing cerebral pathologies, we found miRNAs specifically associated with AD pathology (n = 75), Lewy body pathology (n = 45), arteriolosclerosis (n = 3), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (n = 1), and LATE-NC (n = 4). While some miRNAs were pathology-specific, 14 miRNAs (including those in the miR-132/212 cluster) were associated with both AD pathology and Lewy body pathology, and one (miR-193a-5p) was associated with both AD pathology and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that miRNAs associated with arteriolosclerosis target genes involved in glutathione metabolism, synaptic functions, cellular transport, and innate immune response. These findings highlight the role of miRNAs in age-related cerebral pathologies and provide a foundation for future mechanistic studies.

Highly Stable, Crystalline InGaO Thin-Film Transistors by 7% Lanthanum Incorporation.	The development of high-mobility metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) thin-film transistors (TFTs) is of increasing interest. It is well-known that increasing the indium (In) concentration in MOS enhances the crystal volume fraction and mobility. However, the high carrier concentration resulting from a high In content induces TFT depletion mode and degrades device stability. Here, we introduce the incorporation of lanthanum (La) cation into the high-In-containing indium-gallium oxide (InGaO) films grown by spray pyrolysis at a substrate temperature of 375 °C.

Stratifying risk of Alzheimer's disease in healthy middle-aged individuals with machine learning.	Alzheimer's disease has a prolonged asymptomatic phase during which pathological changes accumulate before clinical symptoms emerge. This study aimed to stratify the risk of clinical disease to inform future disease-modifying treatments. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis from participants in the Emory Healthy Brain Study was used to classify individuals based on amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), total tau (tTau) and phosphorylated tau (pTau) levels. Cognitively normal (CN), biomarker-positive (CN)/BM+individuals were identified using a tTau: Aβ42 ratio > 0.24, determined by Gaussian mixture models.

Physical activity complexity, cognition, and risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.	Studies on physical activity (PA) and dementia mainly focus on activity quantity or intensity. Yet PA requires neuro-coordination of movement, and it is unclear whether complexity of daily activity varies by cognitive status. Thus, we examined the association between PA complexity, using multiscale entropy, and cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia in older adults in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). A total of 637 older adults (age 73.9 ± 11.3 years) in the BLSA completed a 7-day wrist-worn accelerometer assessment and neuropsychological tests from 2015 to 2020. Using logistic regression and structural equation modeling, we examined cross-sectional associations of PA complexity with MCI/dementia and cognition. Cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) were used to assess bidirectional associations at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education years, body mass index, and comorbidities. Participants in the lowest tertile of PA complexity had over double the odds of MCI/dementia (odds ratio = 2.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 6.79, Lower complexity of accelerometry-detected movement is associated with poorer cognition and higher risk of MCI/dementia. Future studies should explore whether low PA complexity is an early indicator of dementia. Prior studies mainly focused on quantity or intensity of physical activity.Poorer cognitive function was associated with lower complexity of daily activity.Lower complexity of physical activity may be an early indicator of dementia.	cognitive function; cognitive impairment; dementia; physical activity; structural equation modeling

Sex modifies the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin resistance in adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.	This study examines whether sex modifies the association between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and insulin resistance in adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study included n = 1,131 (791 females, 340 males; mean age 64.7 years) cognitively unimpaired, nondiabetic participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention, a longitudinal observational cohort study enriched with persons with parental history of AD dementia. CRF was estimated using a validated equation, and the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) quantified insulin resistance from blood samples. Cross-sectional linear regression models were assembled in a moderation framework to test the interaction between CRF and sex on HOMA-IR scores. Finally, sex-stratified analyses were performed to test within-group associations of CRF and HOMA-IR. CRF was negatively associated with HOMA-IR (β = -0.504, SE = 0.21, p = 0.018) and the interaction of CRF and sex was likewise significant (β = -0.849, SE = 0.18, p <0.001). Stratified models showed that the magnitude of the association between CRF and HOMA-IR was over twice as strong among males than females (males: β = -0.837, SE = 0.26, p = 0.001; females: β = -0.400, SE = 0.19, p = 0.03). Among older adults at heightened risk for AD, CRF protects against insulin resistance; however, this association may be stronger in aging males than in females.

Pregnancy and delivery in women with Parkinson's disease: A case series.	BackgroundParkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative disease affecting people at any age; however, it is generally more prevalent in older age groups. Younger individuals, especially women, are facing significant challenges that pertain to pregnancy. Unfortunately, the available information is limited and supported mostly by anecdotical experience.ObjectiveTo gain insight into the interaction between early-onset PD and pregnancy.MethodsWe report on a case series of women, diagnosed with PD, that underwent pregnancy to explore the disease catachrestic, natural history, and different challenges associated with these unique group of people.ResultsWe identified a total of 9 participants who met our inclusion criteria, who had gone through a total of 12 pregnancies after onset of PD motor symptoms. In 10 out of 12 pregnancies, participants did not use any PD medication; throughout 1 pregnancy, a participant used pramipexole and throughout 1 pregnancy, a participant used levodopa/carbidopa.ConclusionsOur study supports the importance of further multicentric studies on pregnant women with PD to prospectively collect data on complications, birth outcomes, lactation, and PD severity.

Associations between anaesthetic dose-adjusted intraoperative EEG alpha power, processing speed, and postoperative delirium: analysis of data from three prospective studies.	We previously have shown that low intraoperative EEG alpha power is associated with impaired preoperative cognition, a delirium risk factor, and that intraoperative anaesthetic-dose-adjusted EEG bispectral index values were associated with a four-fold increased risk of postoperative delirium (POD). Yet, associations between intraoperative anaesthetic-dose-adjusted alpha power and delirium or delirium risk factors have yet to be quantified. We examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related biomarkers, cognitive scores, EEG recordings, and delirium data from 82 noncardiac, non-neurologic surgical patients ≥60 yr in age. Based on prior work, each participant's intraoperative frontoparietal EEG alpha power was anaesthetic dose-adjusted by dividing it by (2.5 minus the age-adjusted end-tidal minimum alveolar concentration), and then analysed for its association with POD and delirium risk factors, preoperative CSF AD-related biomarkers, and preoperative cognition. Lower anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was associated with increased odds of POD (odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.44 [1.09, 1.89], P=0.009) and moderate-to-severe delirium (odds ratio [95% CI]: 1.44 [1.04, 2.00], P=0.030). Anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was not associated with pathologic concentrations of CSF pTau-181, Aβ1-42, or pTau-181/Aβ1-42 (P>0.05). In multivariable cognitive models, anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was associated with preoperative timed processing speed/executive function performance (β [95% CI]: 0.27 [0.06, 0.49], P=0.014), but not with untimed attention/memory performance (β [95% CI]: 0.12 [-0.13, 0.37], P=0.349). Lower intraoperative anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was associated with delirium and delirium-predisposing factors (impaired preoperative processing speed/executive function in timed attention tasks). Larger studies are warranted to confirm these associations after further adjustment for covariates.

Cerebral hypoperfusion, brain structural integrity, and cognitive impairment in older APOE4 carriers.	Cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficits, cognitive decline, and brain structural changes have been reported in older adults with and without apolipoprotein E-e4 (APOE4)-related risk for dementia. However, it remains unclear whether brain structural changes mediate the effects of hypoperfusion on cognitive impairment in APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. We studied 166 (60-89 years) APOE4 carriers (ε3/ε4 or ε4/ε4) and APOE3 homozygotes (e3/e3) with and without cognitive impairment by clinical dementia rating (CDR) and neuropsychological testing. Pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling-MRI assessed regional CBF, and T1-anatomical and diffusion-MRI assessed structural integrity. Mediation analyses examined relationships among grey matter CBF, grey matter volume, and white matter integrity in regions underlying impairment in distinct cognitive ability domains. APOE4 carriers with global/memory impairment (CDR 0.5) exhibited decreased CBF in the posterior cingulate, decreased grey matter volume in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and posterior cingulate, and decreased white matter integrity in the cingulum relative to APOE4 carriers with no impairment (CDR 0). Mediation analysis in APOE4 carriers indicated decreased posterior cingulate CBF effects on global/memory impairment were mediated by decreased cingulum integrity. In the combined APOE4 and APOE3 carriers sample, there were direct effects of frontal and inferior parietal CBF and superior longitudinal fasciculus integrity on attention/executive impairment. There were also direct effects of left inferior frontal CBF on language impairment. Findings suggest links between hypoperfusion and brain structural integrity underlying global/memory impairment in APOE4 carriers. Independent CBF relationships with structural integrity are also identified across genotypes and impairment domains.	Apolipoprotein E; Brain atrophy; Cerebral blood flow; White matter integrity

The effect of Alzheimer's disease genetic factors on limbic white matter microstructure.	White matter (WM) microstructure is essential for brain function but deteriorates with age and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diffusion MRI, enhanced by advanced bi-tensor models accounting for free water (FW), enables in vivo quantification of WM microstructural differences. To evaluate how AD genetic risk factors affect limbic WM microstructure - crucial for memory and early impacted in disease - we conducted linear regression analyses in a cohort of 2,614 non-Hispanic White aging adults (aged 50.12 to 100.85 years). The study evaluated 36 AD risk variants across 26 genes, the association between AD polygenic scores (PGSs) and WM metrics, and interactions with cognitive status. AD PGSs, variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and apolipoprotein E (APOE), and interactions involving MS4A6A were significantly linked to WM microstructure. These findings implicate AD-related genetic factors related to neurodevelopment (WNT3), lipid metabolism (APOE), and inflammation (TMEM106B, PTK2B, MS4A6A) that contribute to alternations in WM microstructure in older adults. AD risk variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and APOE genes showed distinct associations with limbic FW-corrected WM microstructure metrics. Interaction effects were observed between MS4A6A variants and cognitive status. PGS for AD was associated with higher FW content in the limbic system.

Experiences and perceptions of sexism in dementia research careers: A global cross-sectional survey.	Sexism is prevalent in academia and is a crucial factor driving women out of the academic workforce. However, sexism in dementia research remains underexplored. This study aimed to understand the perceptions and experiences of early-career dementia researchers (ECDRs) with sexism in the field. In September/October 2021, a global online survey was conducted targeting ECDRs. The survey assessed their career experiences, including sexism, and was distributed through networks, social media, and e-mail lists. Responses were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Of the 345 respondents, more than half of the female ECDRs (52%) reported facing sexism in their careers, ranging from overt discrimination to subtle biases. Experiences varied by career stage and location, and many ECDRs reported a lack of institutional support. These findings reveal the prevalent nature of sexism in dementia research and highlight the need for targeted interventions to foster a more inclusive research environment. A global survey revealed 52% of female early-career dementia researchers experience sexism. Subtle sexism, like microaggressions, impacts confidence, and collaboration choices. Experiences of sexism vary by geography, with North America reporting higher prevalence. Assistant professors report higher rates of institutional and overt sexism. Findings emphasize the need for policies addressing implicit bias and sex inequality.	Alzheimer's disease; academic careers; early career researchers; sexism

Expression of anti-amyloid CARs in microglia promotes efficient and selective phagocytosis of Aβ1‒42.	Genetic engineering of microglial cells is a promising therapeutic avenue emerging with advancements in gene delivery techniques. Using a recently developed AAV capsid for efficient in vitro transduction we report the engineering of microglia with CARs (CAR-Mic) targeting phagocytosis of amyloid beta 1‒42 (Aβ42). Functional screening of seven CAR constructs in human iPSC-derived microglia revealed up to 6-fold increases in internalized Aβ relative to viral control. CAR-driven phagocytic enhancement was selective for Aβ, dependent on intracellular domain signaling, and was confirmed in primary mouse microglia. These findings highlight the potential of using this approach to target dysfunctional microglia in Alzheimer's disease and other CNS disorders.

Glycated hemoglobin and body mass index as mediators of GLP-1RAs and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in patients with type 2 diabetes.	Whether reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and body mass index (BMI) mediate the association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) risk is unknown. This cohort study included 22,908 patients aged ≥ 50 years with type 2 diabetes (T2D) newly prescribed GLP-1RA or other second-line glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs). Causal mediation analysis was used to estimate to what extent the effect of GLP-1RAs on ADRD risk was attributable to lowering HbA1c or BMI. Compared to other GLD users, GLP-1RA users had significant reductions in HbA1c levels by 0.16% and BMI by 0.23 kg/m GLP-1RAs reduce ADRD risk, largely independent of their effects on HbA1c and BMI. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were associated with reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) compared to other second-line glucose-lowering drugs(GLDs). GLP-1RA users were associated with a 26% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) than other GLD users. The protective effect of GLP-1RAs against ADRD in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is largely independent of their effects on HbA1c and BMI.

Plasma phospho-tau217 for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis in primary and secondary care using a fully automated platform.	Global implementation of blood tests for Alzheimer's disease (AD) would be facilitated by easily scalable, cost-effective and accurate tests. In the present study, we evaluated plasma phospho-tau217 (p-tau217) using predefined biomarker cutoffs. The study included 1,767 participants with cognitive symptoms from 4 independent secondary care cohorts in Malmö (Sweden, n = 337), Gothenburg (Sweden, n = 165), Barcelona (Spain, n = 487) and Brescia (Italy, n = 230), and a primary care cohort in Sweden (n = 548). Plasma p-tau217 was primarily measured using the fully automated, commercially available, Lumipulse immunoassay. The primary outcome was AD pathology defined as abnormal cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42:p-tau181. Plasma p-tau217 detected AD pathology with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.93-0.96. In secondary care, the accuracies were 89-91%, the positive predictive values 89-95% and the negative predictive values 77-90%. In primary care, the accuracy was 85%, the positive predictive values 82% and the negative predictive values 88%. Accuracy was lower in participants aged ≥80 years (83%), but was unaffected by chronic kidney disease, diabetes, sex, APOE genotype or cognitive stage. Using a two-cutoff approach, accuracies increased to 92-94% in secondary and primary care, excluding 12-17% with intermediate results. Using the plasma p-tau217:Aβ42 ratio did not improve accuracy but reduced intermediate test results (≤10%). Compared with a high-performing mass-spectrometry-based assay for percentage p-tau217, accuracies were comparable in secondary care. However, percentage p-tau217 had higher accuracy in primary care and was unaffected by age. In conclusion, this fully automated p-tau217 test demonstrates high accuracy for identifying AD pathology. A two-cutoff approach might be necessary to optimize performance across diverse settings and subpopulations.

Alpha-synuclein regulates nucleolar DNA double-strand break repair in melanoma.	Although an increased risk of the skin cancer melanoma in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) has been shown in multiple studies, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood, but increased expression of the PD-associated protein alpha-synuclein (αSyn) in melanoma cells may be important. Our previous work suggests that αSyn can facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, promoting genomic stability. We now show that αSyn is preferentially enriched within the nucleolus in melanoma, where it colocalizes with DNA damage markers and DSBs. Inducing DSBs specifically within nucleolar ribosomal DNA (rDNA) increases αSyn levels near sites of damage. αSyn knockout increases DNA damage within the nucleolus at baseline, after specific rDNA DSB induction, and prolongs the rate of recovery from this induced damage. αSyn is important downstream of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated signaling to facilitate MDC1-mediated 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs, reducing micronuclei formation and promoting cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion.

GLP-1RA and SGLT2i Medications for Type 2 Diabetes and Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias.	The association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and risk of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) remains to be confirmed. To assess the risk of ADRD associated with GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This target trial emulation study used electronic health record data from OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium from January 2014 to June 2023. Patients were 50 years or older with T2D and no prior diagnosis of ADRD or antidementia treatment. Among the 396 963 eligible patients with T2D, 33 858 were included in the GLP-1RA vs other glucose-lowering drug (GLD) cohort, 34 185 in the SGLT2i vs other GLD cohort, and 24 117 in the GLP-1RA vs SGLT2i cohort. Initiation of treatment with a GLP-1RA, SGLT2i, or other second-line GLD. ADRD was identified using clinical diagnosis codes. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to adjust for potential confounders. This study included 33 858 patients in the GLP-1RA vs other GLD cohort (mean age, 65 years; 53.1% female), 34 185 patients in the SGLT2i vs other GLD cohort (mean age, 65.8 years; 49.3% female), and 24 117 patients in the GLP-1RA vs SGLT2i cohort (mean age, 63.8 years; 51.7% female). In IPTW-weighted cohorts, the incidence rate of ADRD was lower in GLP-1RA initiators compared with other GLD initiators (rate difference [RD], -2.26 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, -2.88 to -1.64]), yielding an HR of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.96). SGLT2i initiators had a lower incidence than other GLD initiators (RD, -3.05 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, -3.68 to -2.42]), yielding an HR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75). There was no difference between GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is, with an RD of -0.09 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, -0.80 to 0.63) and an HR of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.72-1.32). In people with T2D, both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were statistically significantly associated with decreased risk of ADRD compared with other GLDs, and no difference was observed between both drugs.

Addressing overfitting bias due to sample overlap in polygenic risk scoring.	Numerous studies on Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk scores (PRSs) overlook sample overlap between International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and target datasets like Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To address this, we developed overlap-adjusted PRS (OA PRS) and tested it on simulated data to assess biases from different scenarios by varying training, testing, and overlap proportions. OA PRS was used to adjust for sample bias in simulations; then, we applied OA PRS to IGAP and ADNI datasets and validated through visual diagnosis. OA PRS effectively adjusted for sample overlap in all simulation scenarios, as well as for IGAP and ADNI. The original IGAP PRS showed an inflated area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC: 0.915) on overlapping samples. OA PRS reduced the AUROC to 0.726, closely aligning with the AUROC of non-overlapping samples (0.712). Further, visual diagnostics confirmed the effectiveness of our adjustments. With OA PRS, we were able to adjust the IGAP summary-based PRS for the overlapped ADNI samples, allowing the dataset to be fully used without the risk of overfitting. Sample overlap between large Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohorts poses overfitting bias when using AD polygenic risk scores (PRSs). This study highlighted the effectiveness of overlap-adjusted PRS (OA -PRS) in mitigating overfitting and improving the accuracy of PRS estimations. New PRSs based on adjusted effect sizes showed increased power in association with clinical features.

Emotional distress following amyloid PET result disclosure: Heightened among those with cognitive symptoms.	We examined differences in emotional distress following amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) results disclosure across the cognitive spectrum, including individuals who are cognitively unimpaired, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. Seventy-five participants from the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center who completed baseline PET and an initial follow-up call were included in the analysis. Multiple linear regression was employed to examine differences in distress among diagnostic groups, as measured by Impact of Genetic Testing for Alzheimer's Disease (IGT-AD) adapted for amyloid PET. Regression analysis revealed significant associations between diagnostic categories and emotional distress post-disclosure. Pairwise comparisons indicated that those with normal cognition experienced significantly lower distress compared to MCI and dementia groups, even after controlling for amyloid status. Emotional distress following amyloid PET disclosure is significantly higher in cognitively symptomatic individuals compared to the asymptomatic, highlighting the need for tailored counseling and support to address the complex psychological effects of disclosure. Emotional distress was compared across cognitive categories outside trial settings Cognitively unimpaired individuals had significantly lower distress than impaired No significant difference in distress was found between MCI and dementia groups Depression and anxiety did not differ significantly across diagnostic categories.

Maximum sensitivity constrained region based tuning of active disturbance rejection control for industrial applications in presence of time-varying disturbances.	Linear active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) uses conventional Luenberger type linear extended state observer (LESO) and a simple proportional derivative (PD) controller for anti-disturbance applications. Limitation of the linear ADRC lies in its inability to adequately reject time-varying disturbances. Modified ADRC strategies discussed in this manuscript, including LESO-based proportional integral derivative-ADRC (LESO-PID-ADRC) and proportional resonant-ADRC (LESO-PR-ADRC), exhibit the capability to proficiently track ramp and sinusoidal references while effectively suppressing similar disturbances. Additionally, a quasi-generalized integrator-extended state observer based PID-ADRC (QGI-PID-ADRC) is proposed which is capable of tracking both step and ramp references while simultaneously rejecting ramp and sinusoidal disturbances. Furthermore, maximum sensitivity constrained region (MSCR) based graphical tuning approach is presented for the PID and PR controllers. Frequency domain analysis is conducted to illustrate reference tracking and disturbance rejection capability of the designed controllers. Moreover, stability of the closed loop system is illustrated using Nyquist plots. Simulation study is conducted in MATLAB for two complex systems (ship motion model and pressurized water reactor (PWR)) which have associated nonlinearities, time-varying system parameters and modeling uncertainties. The research demonstrates that LESO-PID-ADRC, QGI-PID-ADRC and LESO-PR-ADRC, when tuned using the proposed graphical approach, outperform recently introduced control strategies, excelling in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection.

This cross-sectional study examined associations between 24-hour time-use composition (i.e. sleep, sedentary time, light physical activity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) and cognitive performance and explored whether demographic or genetic factors moderated these relationships. This analysis included baseline data from cognitively unimpaired older adults (n = 648) enrolled in the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise study. Time use was measured using wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers. Cognitive domains were determined using a confirmatory factor analysis from a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Linear regression models tested associations between time-use composition and cognitive factors, adjusting for age, sex, education, body mass index, apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele carriage and study site. Interaction terms evaluated moderation of time use by age, sex, education and APOE4 status. We also examined the theoretical impact of reallocating time between time-use behaviours on cognitive performance using compositional isotemporal substitution methods. Time-use composition was associated with processing speed (F = 5.16, P = .002), working memory (F = 4.81, P = .003) and executive function/attentional control (F = 7.09, P < .001) but not episodic memory (F = 2.28, P = .078) or visuospatial function (F = 2.26, P = .081). Post hoc isotemporal substitution analyses found that significant associations were driven by time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), with lesser amounts of MVPA associated with poorer cognitive performance. There was no evidence of moderation by any tested factors. Increasing or decreasing MVPA, at the expense of time spent in sleep, sedentary behaviour or light physical activity, may be related to individual variation in processing speed, executive function/attentional control and working memory in older adulthood.	cognitive function; older people; physical activity; sedentary behaviour; sleep; time use

GCN-BBB: Deep Learning Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Permeability PharmacoAnalytics with Graph Convolutional Neural (GCN) Network.	The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) is a selective barrier between the Central Nervous System (CNS) and the peripheral system, regulating the distribution of molecules. BBB permeability has been crucial in CNS-targeting drug development, such as glioblastoma-related drug discovery. In addition, more CNS diseases still present significant challenges, for instance, neurological disorders like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and drug abuse. Conversely, cannabinoid drugs that do not cross the BBB are needed to avoid off-target CNS psychotropic effects. In vitro and in vivo experiments measuring BBB permeability are costly and low throughput. Computational pharmacoanalytics modeling, particularly using deep-learning Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offers a promising alternative. GNNs excel at capturing intricate relationships in graph-based information, such as small molecular structures. In this study, we developed GNNs model for BBB permeability using the graph representation of drugs. The GNNs were compared with other algorithms using molecular fingerprints or physical-chemical descriptors. With a dataset of 1924 molecules, the best GNNs model, a convolutional graph neural network using a normalized Laplacian matrix (GCN_2), achieved a precision of 0.94, recall of 0.96, F1 score of 0.95, and MCC score of 0.77. This outperformed other machine learning algorithms with molecular fingerprints. The findings indicate that the graphic representation of small molecules combined with GNNs architecture is powerful in predicting BBB permeability with high accuracy and recall. The developed GNNs model can be utilized in the initial screening stage for new drug development.	BBB; Deep learning; Graph Neural Network (GNN); Permeability; Pharmacoanalytics; Small molecule

Longitudinal associations between lipid panel and cognitive decline modified by APOE 4 carrier status in biracial community-dwelling older adults: Findings from the Chicago health and aging project.	There have been contradictory findings on the associations between lipids and cognitive decline (CD), which may be attributed to the heterogeneity in the APOE4 carrier status, given APOE's lipid transportation roles. However, extant studies rarely examined the modifying effects of APOE4 carrier status on the associations between lipids and CD. We analyzed the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a 20-year cohort study comprising older adults with lipid panel assayed, i.e., total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and longitudinal cognitive tests. We ran adjusted linear mixed-effects models, regressing cognitive test composite on each of the four lipids independently, first with the total sample and subsequently using interaction and stratified subgroup analyses, examining the modifying effects of APOE4 carrier status on the associations. 3,496 biracial community-dwelling older adults were recruited from the South side of Chicago (58% African American & 64% women; mean follow-up = 4.6 years). In the total sample, there was a borderline association between TG and CD, estimate (SD, p-value) = 0.0001 (0.0000,0.0565). No associations were detected with other lipids. In the interaction and subgroup analyses, only in ε4 carriers that higher TC levels were significantly associated with accelerated CD, -0.020 (0.009,0.035), whereas higher TG levels were significantly associated with decelerated CD, 0.001 (0.001,0.045). No modifying effects of ε4 carrier status were detected with other lipids.

Cross-ancestry genome-wide association study identifies implications of SORL1 in cerebral beta-amyloid deposition.	GWAS of Alzheimer's disease have been predominantly based on European ancestry cohorts with clinically diagnosed patients. Increasing the ancestral diversity of GWAS and focusing on imaging brain biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease may lead to the identification of new genetic loci. Here, we perform a GWAS on cerebral β-amyloid deposition measured by PET imaging in 3,885 East Asians and a cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis with data from 11,816 European participants. Our GWAS analysis replicates known loci (APOE4, CR1, and FERMT2) and identifies a novel locus near SORL1 that is significantly associated with β-amyloid deposition. Single-nucleus expression analysis shows that SORL1 is differentially expressed according to β-amyloid positivity in microglia. Our joint association analysis using the SORL1 lead variant (rs76490923) and the APOE4 allele demonstrates that the risk of β-amyloid deposition is reduced by up to 43.5% in APOE4 non-carriers and up to 55.6% in APOE4 carriers, according to the allelic dosage of the rs76490923 T allele. Our findings suggest that SORL1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, particularly in relation to β-amyloid deposition.

The association between measures of sleepiness and subjective cognitive decline symptoms in a diverse population of cognitively normal older adults.	Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is associated with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Suboptimal sleep is also a risk factor for cognitive decline, but with unclear relationship to SCD. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study in a biracial research cohort of 148 cognitively normal older adults who underwent quantification of SCD (Cognitive Change Index; CCI), sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale; ESS), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), and amyloid/tau PET. ESS score was associated with total, amnestic, and non-amnestic CCI scores, after adjustment for GDS, amyloid/tau burden, and race. This supports future longitudinal work on how sleepiness impacts SCD outcomes.

The Association of Circulating Immune Cells with Cognitive Function, Brain Imaging, and Incident all-cause and Alzheimer's Dementia: The Framingham Offspring Study.	Emerging evidence supports the central role of the immune system in brain health, yet little is known about the role of circulating immune cells and cognitive function or brain health in dementia-free populations. We investigated the association of 43 immune cells with cognitive function, structural brain imaging, and incident dementia in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants. Immune cells were phenotyped by flow cytometry. Linear mixed effects models were used for cross-sectional associations between immune cells and four cognitive domain scores and 13 brain MRI measurements. Cox proportional hazards regression models tested the relationship between immune cells and time to dementia. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, CMV status, and APOE genotype, with further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Data was further stratified by CMV status. Among 795 participants with cellular phenotyping, cognitive testing and brain imaging data (mean age 61, 52% women), there were no associations between immune cells and cognitive test scores. Several significant associations between immune cells and regional brain MRI measurements were observed. Higher CD8+ cells [CD8+CD45RO-CCR7-CD27-(Teff), CD8+CD45RA+CD28-CD57+(TEMRA), CD8+CD27-CD28-] associated with greater cerebrum gray and frontal gray matter volumes and inclusion of cardiovascular risk factors strengthened the association. Among CMV+ participants, CD8+TEMRA and CD8+Teff cells were significantly associated with higher total gray and frontal gray matter volumes. No significant associations were observed between immune cells and incident all-cause or Alzheimer's disease dementia. The pathobiology underpinning the associations between immune cells and brain volumes require further study and validation in diverse samples.	T cells; brain MRI; immunity

A Call for Improving Clinical and Cognitive Assessments to Reduce the Gap Between Amyloid/Tau Pathology Onset and Detection of Cognitive Dysfunction.	"In this commentary, we discuss the new perspectives on the definition and criteria for Alzheimer's disease, particularly in relation to the biological and clinical-biological approaches. We argue that research must continue to focus on improving clinical and cognitive tools to contextualize biomarker findings and understand the clinical implications of different pathophysiological processes at the individual level. We propose several solutions, including the development of ""cognitive stress tests,"" digital clinical biomarkers, innovative analytical procedures, more refined studies for collecting rigorous and longitudinal normative data, and, ultimately, enhanced clinical skills. Overall, these strategies could help ""shorten"" the preclinical period and bridge the gap between the biological and clinical-biological approaches by aligning biomarker abnormalities with the onset of cognitive dysfunction more effectively."

Correlates of Patient Trust in Doctors: Demographic Factors and Experiences of Medical Care Discrimination.	When providing healthcare services to diverse populations of middle-aged and older adults, it is important to understand factors that may influence the amount of trust they have in their doctors, such as demographic factors and previous experiences of discrimination. We examined correlates of general trust in doctors in a national sample of adults in the USA. The REGARDS longitudinal cohort study included measures of trust in doctors and discrimination at a follow-up visit. Cross-sectional sequential linear regression models, with general trust in doctors as the outcome, first included demographic factors and then added discrimination in a medical care setting. The baseline REGARDS sample included community-dwelling participants across the contiguous USA who identified as White or Black/African American and were aged 45 or older. Our analytic sample included 8500 participants who completed the second in-home REGARDS visit and were aged 52 years or older. Trust was measured by the General Trust in Doctors Scale. Participants also reported whether they had ever experienced discrimination in a medical care setting. Female sex (b = -1.41, p < 0.05), Black/African American race (b = -0.40, p < 0.05), and having a higher level of education (b = -0.45, p < 0.05) were each independently related to lower trust in doctors. Older age (b = 0.10, p < 0.05) was associated with higher trust. Previous discrimination had a negative association with trust (b = -4.27, p < 0.05) and the relationship between race and trust was reduced to zero (b = 0.28, p = 0.155) with discrimination in the model. Previous discrimination experiences in a medical care setting completely attenuated the relationship between race and trust in doctors, a prominent finding that should be considered when providing healthcare services to diverse populations of adults.

A cerebrospinal fluid synaptic protein biomarker for prediction of cognitive resilience versus decline in Alzheimer's disease.	Rates of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are extremely heterogeneous. Although biomarkers for amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, the hallmark AD pathologies, have improved pathology-based diagnosis, they explain only 20-40% of the variance in AD-related cognitive impairment (CI). To discover novel biomarkers of CI in AD, we performed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics on 3,397 individuals from six major prospective AD case-control cohorts. Synapse proteins emerged as the strongest correlates of CI, independent of Aβ and tau. Using machine learning, we derived the CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 synapse protein ratio, which explained 27% of the variance in CI beyond CSF pTau

Grief and Economic Stressors by Sex, Gender, and Education: Associations With Alzheimer Disease-Related Outcomes.	The prevalence and impact of stressful life events (SLEs) on age-related and Alzheimer disease (AD)-related pathways may depend on social determinants including gender and education. We investigated whether specific SLEs are associated with AD pathology and neurodegeneration and how these associations differ by gender and education. This cross-sectional study included cognitively unimpaired participants, most with a family history of sporadic AD, from the ALzheimer's and FAmilies (ALFA) cohort, based in Barcelona, Spain. Participants had available assessments on occurrence and type of lifetime SLEs and lumbar puncture and/or structural MRI. We performed multiple regression analyses to examine the associations of specific SLE type with (1) AD pathologies (CSF phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181] and β-amyloid [Aβ] 42/40) and (2) neurodegeneration markers (CSF neurogranin and GM volumes voxel-wise) including interaction and stratification analyses by gender (women/men) and education. In total, 1,290 cognitively unimpaired participants (mean age = 59.4 years, range: 48-77 years, 99% White participants, 61% women) were included (393 with lumbar puncture and 1,234 with spectroscopic MRI assessments). Less educated participants and women reported more grief-related and economic-related SLEs. Furthermore, women reported more abuse and reproductive SLEs. Grief-related SLEs were associated with AD and neurodegeneration CSF outcomes while economic SLEs were associated with MRI-based GM outcomes, both in an age-independent manner. Specifically, partner's death was associated with lower Aβ42/40 (B = -5.19; 95% CI -9.61 to -0.76; Older adults at risk of cognitive decline with less education and women may be more susceptible to experience more SLEs. Men who have experienced widowhood and unemployment and women who have experienced financial difficulties may benefit from interventions.

Proteomic Subtyping of Alzheimer's Disease CSF links Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction to Reduced levels of Tau and Synaptic Biomarkers.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by significant clinical and molecular heterogeneity, influenced by genetic and demographic factors. Using an unbiased, network-driven approach, we analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome from 431 individuals (483 samples), including 111 African American participants, to identify core protein modules associated with AD, race, sex, and age. Our analysis revealed ten co-expression modules linked to distinct biological pathways and cell types, many of which correlated with established AD biomarkers such as β-amyloid, tau, and phosphorylated tau. To further resolve disease heterogeneity, we applied a proteomic subtyping approach, identifying six distinct CSF subtypes spanning the clinical and pathological spectrum. These subtypes were validated across independent cohorts, with many aligning with previously defined AD subtypes, including those linked to neuronal hyperplasticity, immune activation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Notably, the BBB subtype, enriched with African Americans and men, was characterized by low CSF tau, high CSF/serum albumin ratios, and reduced synaptic protein levels. This subtype also exhibited increased levels of proteolytic enzymes, including thrombin and matrix metalloproteases, that cleave tau. Plasma dilution into the neuronal hyperplastic AD subtype CSF led to reduced tau and synaptic protein module levels, indicating that plasma protease activity contributes to tau and synaptic protein depletion independent of underlying brain pathology. These findings highlight the impact of BBB integrity on CSF tau levels, particularly in men and African Americans, and underscore the need for diversity-informed AD biomarker strategies to improve diagnostics and therapeutic targeting across populations.

Plasma Biomarkers and Disease Prognosis in Mild Cognitive Impairment with Lewy Bodies.	Little is known about the prognostic value of plasma biomarkers in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB). To investigate the association of four plasma biomarkers with disease progression in MCI. Plasma amyloid-beta (Aβ) Baseline plasma NfL was associated with increased risk of dementia/death in the entire cohort. In MCI-LB, baseline plasma NfL, GFAP, and pTau181 were associated with increased risk of dementia/death and increased cognitive decline measured by the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised. pTau181, GFAP, and NfL are associated with more rapid disease progression in MCI-LB and, with further validation, could be useful to support prognosis and stratification for clinical practice and treatment trials. Further work, including clinicopathological studies, is needed to understand the biological correlates of these markers in MCI-LB. © 2025 The Author(s).

Plasma protein risk scores for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in the Framingham heart study.	It is unclear whether aggregated plasma protein risk scores (PPRSs) could be useful in predicting the risks of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Cox proportional hazard model with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator penalty was used to build the PPRSs for MCI and AD in 1515 Framingham Heart Study Generation 2 with 1128 proteins measured in plasma at exam 5 (cognitively normal [CN] = 1258, MCI = 129, AD = 128). MCI PPRS had a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.97 [5.34, 9.12], with a discriminating power (C-index = 82.52%). AD PPRS had a HR of 5.74 [4.67, 7.05] (C-index = 88.15%). Both PPRSs were also significantly associated with cognitive changes, brain atrophy, and plasma AD biomarkers. Proteins in the MCI and AD PPRSs were involved in several pathways related to leukocyte, chemotaxis, immunity, inflammation, and cellular migration. This study suggests that PPRSs serve well to predict the risk of developing MCI and AD as well as cognitive changes and AD-related pathogenesis in the brain. PPRSs were developed for the risk of AD and AD preclinical stage, MCI. PPRSs were developed for MCI and AD associated with cognitive changes, loss of brain volume, and increasing level of plasma AD biomarkers. Leukocyte, chemotaxis, immunity, inflammation, and cellular migration enriched in proteins were identified as being involved in MCI and AD PPRSs.

Diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 for Alzheimer's disease in clinical and community cohorts.	This study was undertaken to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217/amyloid beta (Aβ) 42 ratio test for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The diagnostic performance of the Lumipulse G plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio was evaluated using Aβ and tau positron emission tomography (PET) as reference standards in a clinic cohort (n = 391) and a community cohort (n = 121). Plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 exhibited high performance for abnormal statuses of Aβ PET (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.963 to 0.966) and tau PET (AUC: 0.947 to 0.974), which were clinically equivalent to those of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau181/Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 and higher than those of blood p-tau217, Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau181, and p-tau181/Aβ42 in both clinic and community cohorts. Applying a two-cutoff approach improved the specificity without reducing sensitivity. The p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio had a lower intermediate percentage than p-tau217 alone in both clinic (10.6% vs 13.0%) and community (16.5% vs 31.4%) cohorts. Plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 has high performance in detecting cerebral AD pathologies, thus offering a promising tool for clinical diagnosis and community screening of AD. Lumipulse G plasma p-tau217 and the p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio accurately identified abnormal Aβ and tau PET statuses in both clinical and community cohorts. The performance of plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio were equivalent to CSF tests. Plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio outperformed p-tau217 alone in identifying Aβ PET positivity, and this superiority is more obvious in the community cohort, suggesting an advantage in the early diagnosis of AD. Two cut points of p-tau217/Aβ42 were established in the Chinese population for clinical laboratory and community screening uses.

Plasma p-tau217 and tau-PET predict future cognitive decline among cognitively unimpaired individuals: implications for clinical trials.	Plasma p-tau217 and tau positron emission tomography (PET) are strong prognostic biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their relative performance in predicting future cognitive decline among cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals is unclear. In a head-to-head comparison study including nine cohorts and 1,474 individuals, we show that plasma p-tau217 and medial temporal lobe tau-PET signal display similar associations with cognitive decline on a global cognitive composite test (R

Sex-specific modulation of FOLR1 and its cycle enzyme genes in Alzheimer's disease brain regions.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive and functional decline. Its incidence increases significantly with age and is more prevalent in women than men. We investigated the folate receptor alpha (FOLR1) gene expression levels in the central nervous system (CNS) of AD and non-demented healthy control (NDHC) subjects. Our cohort included 3,946 samples: 2,391 NDHC and 1,555 AD patients, stratified by brain region, age, and sex. Interestingly, a significant increase in FOLR1 expression was observed only in females with AD compared to NDHC females. Furthermore, we found that FOLR1 expression was differentially increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and diencephalon (DIE) only in AD females. Moreover, in females, genes involved in the folic acid (FA) cycle that drives DNA synthesis were significantly modulated. In contrast, in males, downregulation of TYMS effectively blocks the completion of the cycle, thereby preventing downstream DNA synthesis. Tissue Transcriptome Deconvolution (TTD) analysis revealed astrocytes and endothelial cells associated with FOLR1 expression in both AD males and females. Gene Ontology analysis supported these findings, showing enrichment in processes aligned with these cell types. Positive correlations between brain FOLR1 expression and markers for astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and endothelial cells (CD31) provided further validation. Our findings suggest a potential role for sex-dependent FOLR1 expression and its association with specific brain regions and cellular processes in AD.

Ketamine infusion for pain control in severely injured patients: Results of a randomized controlled trial.	Opiate-based pain regimens remain the cornerstone of pain management following traumatic injury, but issues related to opioids have driven research into alternative analgesics. Adjunctive ketamine has been increasingly used to decrease opioid use, but little evidence exists to support its efficacy within the trauma population. A prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of severely injured (Injury Severity Score [ISS], ≥15) adult patients (aged 18-64 years) admitted to a Level 1 trauma center was conducted. Exclusion criteria included Glasgow Coma Scale score of <14, ISS of <15, pregnancy, and chronic opiate use. All patients were prescribed a patient-controlled analgesia in addition to being randomized to either adjustable dose ketamine starting at 3 μg/kg/min or an equivalent rate of 0.9% normal saline. Study drug and patient-controlled analgesia titration were allowed as part of a treatment algorithm. The primary outcome was reduction in oral morphine equivalent (OME) utilization at 24 hours. We performed a planned interim analysis upon reaching a predetermined enrollment goal. Forty-two of 78 patients (53.8%) were randomized to the experimental arm. Both groups were similar in makeup and had a median ISS of 22 (19, 28.5). The median OMEs in adjustable dose ketamine and placebo groups were 110.6 (55.7, 191.7) and 99.2 (50.6, 172.6), respectively (p = 0.85). No significant difference in OME was found in 24- to 48-hour or the entire 48-hour study period. Adjustable dose ketamine had no impact on pain scores throughout the study period when compared with placebo (4.9 vs. 4.7, p = 0.95). These findings met the futility cutoff, and enrollment was terminated. Adjustable dose ketamine failed to reduce OME totals or pain scores in a severely injured trauma cohort when compared with placebo at any time point. Additional studies are necessary to determine if there is any benefit for adjuvant ketamine in different trauma subpopulations. Therapeutic; Level I.

Periodic disturbance rejection-based control of Switched Reluctance Motors Using ADRC and IMP for effective ripple reduction.	This paper proposes a control scheme that combines Active Disturbance Rejection (ADR) Control and the Internal Model Principle (IMP) to reduce ripple in Switched Reluctance Motors (SRMs) operating at variable speeds. The control architecture consists of two stages: an error-based ADRC for current loops and a periodic disturbance rejection (ADR+IMP) scheme for velocity control. The latter stage exploits two key SRM characteristics: the periodic behavior of signals and disturbances, and the angular-domain periodic nature of torque ripple. Experimental validation is performed on a laboratory test-bed using a 3-phase 12/8 SRM, where the proposed methodology is systematically applied. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme in achieving significant ripple reduction under variable velocity profiles.

Amyloid PET predicts longitudinal functional and cognitive trajectories in a heterogeneous cohort.	Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly available for diagnosis of Alzheimer`s disease (AD); however, its practical implications in heterogenous cohorts are debated. Amyloid PET from 890 National Alzheimer`s Coordinating Center participants with up to 10 years post-PET follow up was analyzed. Cox proportional hazards and linear mixed models were used to investigate amyloid burden prediction of etiology and prospective functional status and cognitive decline. Amyloid positivity was associated with progression from unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Amyloid burden in the unimpaired group was associated with lower initial memory levels and faster decline in memory, language, and global cognition. In the Impaired group, amyloid was associated with lower initial levels and faster decline for memory, language, executive function, and global cognition. Amyloid burden is an important prognostic marker in a clinically heterogeneous cohort. Future work is needed to establish the proportion of decline driven by AD versus non-AD processes in the context of mixed pathology. Our findings highlight the importance of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) in heterogenous cohorts, including diverse demographics, clinical syndromes, and underlying etiologies. The results also provide evidence that higher amyloid levels were linked to functional progression from unimpaired cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to dementia. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, higher amyloid burden was associated with poorer memory at baseline and subsequent declines in memory, language, and global cognition. Among individuals with cognitive impairment, amyloid burden was associated with worse initial memory, language, executive function, and global cognition, and faster declines over time.

The goal of this paper is to introduce the hypothesis that white matter (WM) and vascular injury are long-term consequences of repetitive head impacts (RHI) that result in a novel T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging pattern. A non-systematic literature review of autopsy and FLAIR studies of RHI-exposed adults was first conducted as a foundation for our hypothesis. A case series of RHI-exposed participants is presented to illustrate the unique FLAIR WM hyperintensities (WMH) pattern. Current literature shows a direct link between RHI and later-life WM/vascular neuropathologies, and that FLAIR WMH are associated with RHI, independent of modifiable vascular risk factors. Initial observations suggest a distinctive pattern of WMH in RHI-exposed participants, termed RHI-associated WMH (RHI-WMH). RHI-WMH defining features are as follows: (1) small, punctate, non-confluent, (2) spherical, and (3) proximal to the gray matter. Our hypothesis serves as a call for research to empirically validate RHI-WMH and clarify their biological and clinical correlates. HIGHLIGHTS: Repetitive head impacts (RHI) have been associated with later-life white matter (WM) and vascular neuropathologies. T2 FLAIR MRI of RHI-exposed participants reveals a potentially unique WM hyperintensity (WMH) pattern that is termed RHI-associated WMH (RHI-WMH). RHI-WMH are characterized as (1) small, punctate, and non-confluent, (2) spherical, and (3) proximal to the gray matter at an area anatomically susceptible to impact injury, such as the depths of the cortical sulci.

Novel blood-based proteomic signatures across multiple neurodegenerative diseases.	Blood-based biomarkers have the potential to support early and accurate diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sensitive to molecular pathology and are predictive of outcome. We evaluated a novel multiplex proteomic method in people with diverse neurodegenerative diseases. Serum from people with Alzheimer's disease (N = 36), Lewy body dementia (N = 34), frontotemporal dementia (N = 36), and progressive supranuclear palsy (N = 36) and age-matched controls (N = 30) was analyzed with the nucleic acid linked immuno-sandwich assay (NULISA) central nervous system panel (≈ 120 analytes) and inflammation panel (250 analytes). Biomarkers were compared across groups and included as predictors of survival. The NULISA panels demonstrated high sensitivity and reliability for detecting multiple biomarkers across neurodegenerative disorders. There were condition-specific proteomic biomarkers, while neurofilament light chain, corticotropin-releasing hormone, CD276, and a data-driven inflammation pattern were significant transdiagnostic outcome predictors. The sensitive NULISA multiplex approach supports differential diagnosis and target identification, with prognostically informative dementia-related biomarkers. We tested the novel technology nucleic acid linked immuno-sandwich assay (NULISA) in people with diverse neurodegenerative diseases, which demonstrated high sensitivity and reliability for detecting multiple biomarkers in serum samples. We compared the NULISA central nervous system serum results to single molecule array (Simoa) plasma assays for phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, p-tau231, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein, finding strong correlations. Increased levels of serum NfL were identified across all patient groups and most elevated in the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) cohorts, while p-tau epitopes were the most significant markers in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia. Patients with FTD and PSP showed upregulation of many inflammation markers, compared to controls and patients with AD. We found condition-specific proteomic biomarkers, while NfL, corticotropin-releasing hormone, CD276, and data-driven immune signatures were significant transdiagnostic predictors of clinical outcomes (survival rates).	blood‐based biomarkers; dementia; multiplex assays; non–Alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative diseases; nucleic acid linked immuno‐sandwich assay

Targeting of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 by a Qβ virus-like particle vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic, and reduces disease severity in mice and rhesus macaques.	"Pathological accumulation of tau (pTau) contributes to various tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and correlates with cognitive decline. A rapid surge in tau-targeted approaches via anti-sense oligonucleotides, active/passive immunotherapies suggests that targeting p-Tau is a viable strategy against tauopathies. We describe a multi-species validation of our previously described Qß virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine technology targeting phosphorylated tau on threonine 181 (pT181-Qß). Two vaccine doses of pT181-Qß, without any adjuvants, elicited robust antibody responses in two different mouse models of tauopathy (PS19 and hTau) and rhesus macaques. In mouse models, vaccination reduced AT180+ hyperphosphorylated, Sarkosyl insoluble, Gallyas silver positive tau, inflammasomes/neuroinflammation, and improved recognition memory and motor function without inducing adverse T-cell activation. Anti-pT181 antibodies are reactive to pTau in human AD brains, engage pT181+ tau in human brain lysates, and are central nervous system bioavailable. Our results suggest the translational utility of pT181-Qß against tauopathies. Icosahedral display of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (pT181) Qß virus-like particle surface (""pT181-Qß"" vaccine) induces a robust immune response in mice and in non-human primates (NHPs) pT181-Qß vaccination reduces pathological tau (pTau) and brain atrophy, and improves memory and motor function in PS19 and hTau mice. pT181-Qß vaccination-induced immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) are safe, Th2 skewed (anti-inflammatory), specific to pTau in human AD brain, and efficiently engage pT181 in NHPs and human brain lysate. pT181"	Alzheimer's disease; PS19; hTau; immunotherapy; mild cognitive impairment; non‐human primates; pT181; rhesus macaques; tau; tauopathies; vaccines; virus‐like particles

BOLD amplitude correlates of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a long preclinical stage during which molecular markers of amyloid beta and tau pathology rise, but there is minimal neurodegeneration or cognitive decline. Previous literature suggests that measures of brain function might be more sensitive to neuropathologic burden during the preclinical stage of AD than conventional measures of macrostructure, such as cortical thickness. Among studies that used resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) acquisitions with Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast, most employed connectivity-based analytic approaches. Consequently, little is known about the effects of amyloid and tau pathology on amplitude of intrinsic BOLD signal fluctuations. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized the effects of preclinical and prodromal AD on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the BOLD signal both at the whole-brain level and at a more granular level focused on subregions of the medial temporal lobe. We observed reduced ALFF in both preclinical and prodromal AD. In preclinical AD, amyloid positivity was associated with a spatially diffuse ALFF reduction in the frontal, medial parietal, and lateral temporal association cortices. In contrast, tau pathology was negatively associated with ALFF in the entorhinal cortex. These ALFF effects were observed in the absence of observable macrostructural changes in preclinical AD and remained after adjusting for structural atrophy in prodromal AD, indicating that ALFF offers additional sensitivity to early disease processes beyond what is provided by traditional structural imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration. We conclude that ALFF may be a promising imaging-based biomarker in preclinical AD.	Alzheimer’s disease; Amplitude of spontaneous brain activity; Molecular biomarkers; Preclinical; Resting-state fMRI

Baseline associations of office and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring with cognitive function and dementia prevalence.	BackgroundHigh blood pressure has been associated with dementia prevalence and incident. However, it is unclear the relationship of office and ambulatory BP monitoring with cognitive function and dementia and in particular, it remains unknown whether ambulatory BP variability relates to dementia.ObjectiveTo investigate the associations of office and 24-h blood pressure (BP) with cognitive function and dementia prevalence.MethodsCross-sectional population-based study of 1435 participants aged ≥40 years with office BP/24-h BP, and cognitive assessments (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and Selective Reminding Test [SRT]). Dementia was diagnosed with a clinical dementia rating ≥1.0. Statistics included logistic and linear regression models.ResultsThe mean age was 63.8 ± 10.3 years old and 995 (69.3%) were women. Out of the 1435 participants, 46 (3.20%) had dementia at baseline. Office and 24-h BP levels were not associated with dementia but with one SRT. Increasing 24-h systolic BP variability was associated with lower MMSE (adjusted mean, -0.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.13, -0.03), and SRT (adjusted means ranged from -0.13 to -0.06; 95% CI ranging from -0.19 to -0.01) scores and 1.48-fold greater odds of dementia (95% CI, 1.09-2.02) regardless of BP level.ConclusionsElevated 24-h BP variability, not the BP level, seems to have a stronger association with lower cognitive function and dementia prevalence. Prospective studies are needed to address whether 24-h BP variability relates to cognitive decline and dementia incidence.

RILP cleavage links an inflammatory state to enhanced tau propagation in a cell culture model of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive spread of tau pathology throughout the brain. Inflammation has been demonstrated to be present in the disease state as well as changes in endocytic trafficking. Here we identify the Rab7 effector RILP, a protein at the intersection of inflammatory states and endocytic trafficking, as a novel player in tau propagation. We show that RILP is cleaved in AD brain and this cleavage correlates to increases in hyperphosphorylated tau. Cleavage can be induced in both BE(2) neuron-like cells as well as a microglia cell line when they are treated with the inflammatory mediators lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP. This inflammatory state also enhances tau propagation between BE(2) cells, an effect that is mitigated by overexpressing a noncleavable RILP. Furthermore, microglial cells contribute to intercellular tau propagation through both the release of inflammation-associated factors and the direct uptake and secretion of tau, potentially via extracellular vesicles (EVs). In HMC3 microglial cells, RILP cleavage led to impaired tau degradation, increasing intracellular tau accumulation. Additionally, the RILP cleavage status influences EV secretion in microglia. These findings suggest that RILP cleavage alters the endocytic trafficking of tau causing increased cell-cell propagation in a cell-culture model of AD.

Cardiovascular rate pressure product is associated with NfL in older adults at risk for AD.	Elevated cardiovascular rate pressure product (RPP) has been shown to predict cardiovascular mortality and is associated with poor cognitive test performance among older adults. However, it is unclear how RPP is related to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. RPP was cross-sectionally evaluated as a predictor of CSF biomarker levels in a cohort of 310 cognitively unimpaired late-middle-aged adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease. The primary outcomes were CSF levels of α-Synuclein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light (NfL), soluble triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2, and total tau. Further analyses examined amyloid beta (Aβ)42/Aβ40, phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181), and pTau181/Aβ4. RPP was positively associated with NfL (β = 0.006, A high myocardial oxygen demand at rest may be related to neuronal death and axonal degeneration in cognitively unimpaired late-middle-aged adults. We explored the relationship between RPP and CSF analytes.Higher RPP was associated with higher NfL but not other measured CSF biomarkers.HR was positively associated with NfL, whereas SBP was not.

Longitudinal excitation-inhibition balance altered by sex and APOE-ε4.	Neuronal hyperexcitation affects memory and neural processing across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive continuum. Levetiracetam, an antiepileptic, shows promise in improving cognitive impairment by restoring the neural excitation/inhibition balance in AD patients. We previously identified a hyper-excitable phenotype in cognitively unimpaired female APOE-ε4 carriers relative to male counterparts cross-sectionally. This sex difference lacks longitudinal validation; however, clarifying the vulnerability of female ε4-carriers could better inform antiepileptic treatment efficacy. Here, we investigated this sex-by-ε4 interaction using a longitudinal design. We used resting-state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging collected longitudinally from 106 participants who were cognitively unimpaired for at least one scan event but may have been assessed to have clinical dementia ratings corresponding to early mild cognitive impairment over time. By including scan events where participants transitioned to mild cognitive impairment, we modeled the trajectory of the whole-brain excitation-inhibition ratio throughout the preclinical cognitively healthy continuum and extended to early impairment. A linear mixed model revealed a significant three-way interaction among sex, ε4-status, and time, with female ε4-carriers showing a significant hyper-excitable trajectory. These findings suggest a possible pathway for preventative therapy targeting preclinical hyperexcitation in female ε4-carriers.

Linking genomic and proteomic signatures to brain amyloid burden: insights from GR@ACE/DEGESCO.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease with a strong genetic component, yet many genetic risk factors remain unknown. We combined genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on amyloid endophenotypes measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) as surrogates of amyloid pathology, which may provide insights into the underlying biology of the disease. We performed a meta-GWAS of CSF Aβ42 and PET measures combining six independent cohorts (n = 2,076). Given the opposite beta direction of Aβ phenotypes in CSF and PET measures, only genetic signals showing opposite directions were considered for analysis (n = 376,599). We explored the amyloidosis signature in the CSF proteome using SOMAscan proteomics (ACE cohort, n = 1,008), connected it with GWAS loci modulating amyloidosis and performed an enrichment analysis of overlapping hits. Finally, we compared our results with a large meta-analysis using publicly available datasets in CSF (n = 13,409) and PET (n = 13,116). After filtering the meta-GWAS, we observed genome-wide significance in the rs429358-APOE locus and annotated nine suggestive hits. We replicated the APOE loci using the large CSF-PET meta-GWAS, identifying multiple AD-associated genes including the novel GADL1 locus. Additionally, we found 1,387 FDR-significant SOMAscan proteins associated with CSF Aβ42 levels. The overlap among GWAS loci and proteins associated with amyloid burden was minimal (n = 35). The enrichment analysis revealed mechanisms connecting amyloidosis with the plasma membrane's anchored component, synapse physiology and mental disorders that were replicated in the large CSF-PET meta-analysis. Combining CSF and PET amyloid GWAS with CSF proteome analyses may effectively elucidate causative molecular mechanisms behind amyloid mobilization and AD physiopathology.

Escitalopram for agitation in Alzheimer's dementia: a randomized controlled phase 3 trial.	Citalopram is effective in treating agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AD), but it is associated with cognitive and cardiac risks, likely due to its R-enantiomer. Escitalopram, the S-enantiomer, may be an alternative. In this double-masked randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in treating agitation in AD after failure of a psychosocial intervention (PSI). Assessments occurred at enrollment, post-PSI (baseline) and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks post-baseline. Settings were 27 community-based centers. The target randomization sample was 392 participants. Participants were adults with AD, a Mini-Mental State Examination Telephone score of 3-20 and significant agitation. PSI non-responders received escitalopram (up to 15 mg per day) or placebo for 12 weeks while continuing PSI. The outcome was the proportion of participants with clinically significant improvement in agitation from baseline at 12 weeks. In total, 173 participants were randomized (84 escitalopram versus 89 placebo; mean ± s.d. age = 78.4 ± 8.7 years; 90 men (52.0%); 127 White (73.4%)). The unadjusted risk difference at 12 weeks was 0.08 (95% confidence interval: -0.21, 0.06). Drug-related QT interval prolongation was observed. Although the randomized sample was smaller than planned, escitalopram was not effective in treating agitation in AD and was associated with cardiac conduction delays. Clinicians need to be cautious in recommending escitalopram as an alternative to citalopram for this condition. ClincialTrials.gov identifier: NCT03108846 .

APOE4 Exerts Partial Diet-dependent Effects on Energy Expenditure and Skeletal Muscle Mitochondrial Pathways in a Preclinical Model.	Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the greatest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's (AD) and is linked to whole-body metabolic dysfunction. However, it is unclear how APOE4 interacts with modifiable factors like diet to impact tissues central to regulating whole-body metabolism. We examined APOE4- and Western diet-driven effects in skeletal muscle using APOE3 (control) and APOE4 targeted replacement mice on a C57BL/6NTac background fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% kcal fat) or low-fat diet (LFD, 10% kcal fat) for 4 months (n = 7-8 per genotype/diet/sex combination). We assessed body composition and whole-body outcomes linked to skeletal muscle function including respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and resting energy expenditure (REE). In skeletal muscle, we evaluated the proteome and mitochondrial respiration. In males only, APOE4 drove greater gains in fat mass and lower gains in lean mass on both diets. APOE4 did not affect daily RER but was associated with elevated REE in males and lower REE in HFD females after covarying for body composition. Skeletal muscle proteomics showed APOE4 exerts several diet- and sex-specific effects on mitochondrial pathways, including elevations in branched-chain amino catabolism in HFD males and reductions in oxidative phosphorylation in LFD females. This did not translate to differences in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms may sustain mitochondrial function at this age. Our work indicates that genetic risk may mediate early life effects on skeletal muscle mitochondria and energy expenditure that are partially dependent on diet. This has important implications for mitigating ad risk in APOE4 carriers.	APOE4; Alzheimer's; mice; mitochondria; proteomics; skeletal muscle; whole-body metabolism

Association of Cardiovascular Health With Brain Volume and White Matter Integrity: Results of the SOL-INCA MRI Study.	Better cardiovascular health (CVH), measured using the Life's Simple 7 (LS7) score, is associated with improved cognitive function. However, its effect on brain imaging in Hispanics/Latinos has not been reported. We investigated the association of LS7 score with brain MRI outcomes in a diverse Hispanic/Latino population. Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) is the largest prospective cohort study of diverse Hispanic/Latino adults in the United States. LS7 score was assessed at baseline (2008-2011). The SOL-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) MRI ancillary study recruited HCHS/SOL participants who underwent neuroimaging approximately 10 years (2017-2022) later. Main outcomes include standardized residuals for total brain, total and lobar gray matter (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital), total white matter, total CSF, lateral ventricle (LV), and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes and diffusion tensor imaging (mean free water fraction, peak width skeletonized mean diffusivity, and mean fractional anisotropy). MRI outcomes across continuous LS7 scores were investigated using adjusted linear regression models. We performed an interaction analysis by age and sex. All analyses accounted for complex sample design. The study included 2,659 participants (weighted %female = 56%). The mean age (95% CI) was 54 (53-55) years, and the mean LS7 score was 7.2 (7.1-7.3). In the fully adjusted model, higher LS7 scores were associated with larger total and lobar brain volumes (β We found that better CVH is associated with better brain-based volumes and microstructural integrity and that the effects of LS7 score on brain health are age dependent. Additional studies are needed to assess the longitudinal effect of CVH on MR-based brain health outcomes.

Safety and efficacy of long-term gantenerumab treatment in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease: an open-label extension of the phase 2/3 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled platform DIAN-TU trial.	Amyloid plaque removal by monoclonal antibody therapies slows clinical progression in symptomatic Alzheimer's disease; however, the potential for delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in asymptomatic people is unknown. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) is an ongoing platform trial assessing the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational products in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). Based on findings of amyloid removal and downstream biological effects from the gantenerumab group of the platform trial, we continued a 3-year open-label extension (OLE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with high doses of gantenerumab. The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 multi-arm trial (DIAN-TU-001) assessed solanezumab or gantenerumab versus placebo in participants who were between 15 years before and 10 years after their estimated years to symptom onset and who had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0 (cognitively normal) to 1 (mild dementia). This study was followed by an OLE study of gantenerumab treatment, conducted at 18 study sites in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Spain, the UK, and the USA. For inclusion in the OLE, participants at risk for DIAD had participated in the double-blind period of DIAN-TU-001 and were required to know their mutation status. We investigated increasing doses of subcutaneous gantenerumab up to 1500 mg every 2 weeks. Due to the lack of a regulatory path for gantenerumab, the study was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis (when most participants had completed 2 years of treatment) of the clinical measure CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). The primary outcome for the final analysis was the amyloid plaque measure Of 74 participants who were recruited into the OLE study between June 3, 2020, and April 22, 2021, 73 were enrolled and received gantenerumab treatment. 47 (64%) stopped dosing due to early termination of the study by the sponsor, and 13 (18%) prematurely discontinued the study for other reasons; 13 people completed 3 years of treatment. The mITT group for the primary analysis comprised 55 participants. At the interim analysis, the hazard ratio for clinical decline of CDR-SB in asymptomatic mutation carriers was 0·79 (n=53 [95% CI 0·47 to 1·32]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab in either the double-blind or OLE period (Any Gant), and 0·53 (n=22 [0·27 to 1·03]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab the longest (Longest Gant). At the final analysis, the adjusted mean change from OLE baseline to year 3 in PiB-PET SUVR was -0·71 SUVR (95% CI -0·88 to -0·53, p<0·0001). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities occurred in 53% (39 of 73) of participants: 47% (34 of 73) with microhaemorrhages, 30% (22 of 73) with oedema, and 6% (five of 73) were associated with superficial siderosis. No treatment-associated macrohaemorrhages or deaths occurred. Partial or short-term amyloid removal did not show significant clinical effects. However, long-term full amyloid removal potentially delayed symptom onset and dementia progression. Our conclusions are limited due to the OLE design and use of external controls and need to be confirmed in long-term trials.

Plasma levels of the neuron damage markers brain-derived tau and glial fibrillary acidic protein in Lyme neuroborreliosis: A longitudinal study.	A reliable blood biomarker for neuroborreliosis (NB) has yet to be identified. This study investigated levels of neuron damage markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and brain-derived tau (BD-tau) over six months of follow-up in patients with NB. The aim was to evaluate the potential of these biomarkers for monitoring treatment response and prognostic purposes. A retrospective longitudinal cohort study including plasma collected at diagnosis and approximately three- and six-months post diagnosis from adult NB patients enrolled at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet between 2018 and 2020. BD-tau concentrations were measured in-house using the Single Molecule Array (Simoa) HD-X platform, while GFAP concentrations were assessed on the same platform utilizing the GFAP Discovery Kit. Changes in biomarker concentrations were analyzed using linear mixed models with an unstructured covariance pattern, with follow-up included as a categorical fixed effect. A total of 23 patients (median age: 63 years; male/female ratio: 16/7) with 56 plasma samples were analyzed; 12 patients had complete samples. GFAP and BD-tau levels showed minimal variation throughout the study period. Patients with persistent symptoms had GFAP concentrations that were 55 % higher at diagnosis compared to those who fully recovered, though this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). No significant associations were observed between biomarker levels and treatment response or long-term outcomes. This longitudinal study did not find BD-tau or GFAP to be effective blood biomarkers for monitoring treatment response or predicting outcomes in NB.

The Association of Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment With Outpatient Ambulatory Care Utilization in the Community.	Ambulatory care is critical in delivering interventions for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), from basic services to novel therapeutics. Yet, little is known regarding how community-dwelling persons with dementia/MCI interact with clinicians in outpatient ambulatory settings. We assessed associations of dementia/MCI with outpatient ambulatory evaluation and management (E&M) visits. We included 2116 community-dwelling participants in Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts, with linked fee-for-service Medicare claims. Annually from 2011 to 2019, cohort neuropsychologic evaluations classified participants as dementia, MCI, or no cognitive impairment (NCI). Across groups, we compared annual probability of visiting providers and number of E&M visits, using repeated measures logistic or generalized Poisson mixed effects models. Across 8672 person-years (PY) of follow-up, the mean age was 82 (SD 7.6) years; 77% of PYs were among females and 24% among Black participants. Controlling for demographics and comorbidity, the annual predicted probability of primary care visits was high in all groups (86%-92%). Although there were few visits with dementia-related specialists, we found a higher probability of these visits among those with dementia (15%) and MCI (17%) than NCI (12%; p = 0.009, dementia vs. NCI; p < 0.001, MCI vs. NCI). There were striking differences in visits to other medical specialties: the mean number of annual visits was 40% lower for those with dementia (p < 0.001) and 10% lower for MCI (p < 0.001) than NCI. Overall, dementia and MCI were associated with 19% (p < 0.001) and 4% (p = 0.005) fewer E&M visits, respectively, compared to NCI. Older adults with dementia and MCI interact with primary care providers regularly and are more likely to use dementia-related specialists than those with NCI. Yet, we found lower utilization of other medical specialties, without compensatory increases in primary care, leading to fewer overall E&M visits, even in MCI. Together, the findings may suggest lost opportunities to address the scope of health issues in vulnerable groups.	dementia; mild cognitive impairment; outpatient ambulatory care; primary care; specialty care

Research on yarn tension control technology for knitting underwear machine based on adaptive ADRC.	During the operation of the knitting underwear machine, unstable yarn tension can have adverse effects on the quality of the underwear fabric, such as uneven density and reduced resilience, which significantly diminishes the comfort and durability of the textile products. In response to the issues of slow tension response speed and low tension control accuracy in the traditional yarn feeding method of current knitting underwear machines, a tension control system has been designed for the yarn feeding process. The system employs an adaptive ADRC algorithm, which is based on fuzzy sliding mode control, to detect the real-time trend of yarn tension changes, adjust the real-time target speed of the yarn feeding motor, and then utilizes permanent magnet synchronous motor vector control technology to drive the motor operation. This reduces tension disturbances during the yarn feeding process, enhances the response speed during sudden tension changes, and achieves precise control of yarn tension. Finally, a tension controllable yarn feeding experimental platform was constructed to simulate the knitting underwear machine, and tests were conducted to evaluate the control effectiveness of the yarn feeding tension control system under various algorithm controls. The results show that the control system based on the adaptive ADRC algorithm reduces the amplitude of tension fluctuation in the yarn target tension stabilization phase by more than 33% compared to traditional PID and ADRC algorithms. The average response time is shortened by over 35%, respectively. These comparative data demonstrate that the system can enhance the stability of yarn tension control during the yarn feeding process while meeting the varying elasticity demands of different fabrics and the specific yarn feeding speed requirements of various knitting processes, ultimately ensuring fabric quality.

Accurate staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is crucial for therapeutic trials and prognosis, but existing fluid biomarkers lack specificity, especially for assessing tau deposition severity, in amyloid-beta (Aβ)-positive patients. We analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 136 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using more than 6,000 proteins. We apply machine learning to predict AD pathological stages defined by amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET). We identify two distinct protein panels: 16 proteins, including neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), that distinguished Aβ-negative/tau-negative (A-T-) from A+ individuals and nine proteins, such as HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), that differentiated A+T+ from A+T- stages. These signatures outperform the established CSF biomarkers (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.92 versus 0.67-0.70) and accurately predicted disease progression over a decade. The findings are validated in both internal and external cohorts. These results underscore the potential of proteomic-based signatures to refine AD diagnostic criteria and improve patient stratification in clinical trials.

Data-driven evaluation of suitable immunogens for improved antibody selection.	Antibodies are indispensable in laboratory and clinical applications due to their high specificity and affinity for protein antigens. However, selecting the right protein fragments as immunogens for antibody production remains challenging. Leveraging the Human Protein Atlas, this study systematically evaluates immunogen properties aiming to identify key factors that influence their suitability. Antibodies were classified as successful or unsuccessful based on standardized validation experiments, and the structural and functional properties of their immunogens were analyzed. Results indicated that longer immunogens often resulted in more successful but less specific antibodies. Shorter immunogens (50 residues or fewer) with disordered or unfolded regions at the N- or C-terminus and long coil stretches were more likely to generate successful antibodies. Conversely, immunogens with high beta sheet content, transmembrane regions, or disulfide bridges were associated with poorer antibody performance. Post-translational modification sites within immunogens appeared to mark beneficial regions for antibody generation. To support antibody selection, a novel R package, immunogenViewer, was developed, enabling researchers to easily apply these insights when immunogen sequences are disclosed. By providing a deeper understanding of immunogen suitability, this study promotes the development of more effective antibodies, ultimately addressing issues of reproducibility and reliability in antibody-based research. The findings are highly relevant to the research community, as end users often lack control over the immunogen selection process in antibody production. The R package is freely available as part of Bioconductor: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/immunogenViewer.html.

Higher plasma neurofilament-light chain concentration in drug-resistant epilepsy.	Drug-resistant epilepsy is the most severe form of epilepsy and is frequently associated with cognitive decline. Whether drug-resistant epilepsy results in neurodegeneration or other types of brain injury is not known, and early detection of detrimental clinical trajectories would be clinically very useful. Blood biomarkers of brain injury reflect neurodegeneration or brain injury in several brain diseases but have not been extensively studied in epilepsy. We investigated a panel of such markers in a large epilepsy cohort with an emphasis on assessing differences between drug-resistant and monotherapy-controlled epilepsy. Blood neurofilament light, glial fibrillary acidic protein, total tau, S100 calcium-binding protein B and neuron-specific enolase concentrations were measured in 444 patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with epilepsy participating in a prospective regional Biobank study in Västra Götaland (Sweden). Multiple linear regression assessed associations between clinical variables and marker levels. Levels were then compared between patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (	blood-based biomarkers; brain injury; drug-resistant epilepsy; neurodegeneration

The role of a specialized memory clinic supporting primary care providers in a safety net health system.	Although most dementia care occurs in primary care, consultation with dementia specialty care is sometimes indicated. Access to dementia specialists is limited, particularly in resource-limited environments such as the public health safety net, which may require triaging referrals to preserve access for patients with needs that can not be met in a primary care setting. The eConsult system for primary care providers to refer patients to a subspecialty memory clinic is described for a large safety net health system. Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented for patients evaluated within the memory clinic setting compared to the health system overall. ICD-10-CM codes were used to identify cognitive diagnoses and medical comorbidities. Chi-squared tests were used to compare categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. 94 individuals age 50 or older were seen in the memory clinic in 2019, of whom 43 were new evaluations. The most common visit diagnoses for new memory clinic patients were Alzheimer's disease (33%), no cognitive diagnosis (28%), unspecified dementia (19%), and mild cognitive impairment (12%); for follow up patients, the most common diagnoses were Alzheimer's disease (49%), unspecified dementia (18%), no cognitive diagnosis (14%), and mild cognitive impairment (10%). For those without a cognitive diagnosis, common visit diagnoses included cognitive symptoms, mood or sleep disorders, and metabolic disturbances. Of the 11 new internal referrals with a prior coded diagnosis of dementia, median time from first diagnosis to their initial memory clinic visit was 224 days. Despite clear systemwide parameters for referral and extensive pre-referral screening via an eConsult system, the most common diagnosis for memory clinic patients was Alzheimer's disease. Direct studies of eConsult are needed to determine primary care providers' needs when referring patients with dementia to a memory clinic setting.

Computational memory capacity predicts aging and cognitive decline.	Memory is a crucial cognitive function that deteriorates with age. However, this ability is normally assessed using cognitive tests instead of the architecture of brain networks. Here, we use reservoir computing, a recurrent neural network computing paradigm, to assess the linear memory capacities of neural-network reservoirs extracted from brain anatomical connectivity data in a lifespan cohort of 636 individuals. The computational memory capacity emerges as a robust marker of aging, being associated with resting-state functional activity, white matter integrity, locus coeruleus signal intensity, and cognitive performance. We replicate our findings in an independent cohort of 154 young and 72 old individuals. By linking the computational memory capacity of the brain network with cognition, brain function and integrity, our findings open new pathways to employ reservoir computing to investigate aging and age-related disorders.

Novel modelling approaches to elucidate the genetic architecture of resilience to Alzheimer's disease.	"Up to 30% of older adults meet pathological criteria for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at autopsy yet never show signs of cognitive impairment. Recent work has highlighted genetic drivers of this resilience, or better-than-expected cognitive performance given a level of neuropathology, that allow the aged brain to protect itself from the downstream consequences of amyloid and tau deposition. However, models of resilience have been constrained by reliance on measures of neuropathology, substantially limiting the number of participants available for analysis. We sought to determine if novel approaches using APOE allele status, age, and other demographic variables as a proxy for neuropathology could still effectively quantify resilience and uncover novel genetic drivers associated with better-than-expected cognitive performance while vastly expanding sample size and statistical power. Leveraging 20,513 participants from eight well-characterized cohort studies of aging, we determined the effects of genetic variants on resilience metrics using mixed-effects regressions. The outcome of interest was residual cognitive resilience, quantified from residuals in three cognitive domains (memory, executive function, and language) and built within two frameworks: ""silver"" models, which obviate the requirement for neuropathological data (n=17,241), and ""gold"" models, which include post-mortem neuropathological assessments (n=3,272). We then performed cross-ancestry genome wide association studies (European ancestry n=18,269, African ancestry n=2,244), gene and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses. All analyses were conducted across all participants and repeated when restricted to those with unimpaired cognition at baseline. Despite different modeling approaches, the silver and gold phenotypes were highly correlated (R=0.77-0.88) and displayed comparable performance in quantifying better-than or worse-than-expected cognition, enabling silver-gold meta-analyses. Genetic correlation analyses highlighted associations of resilience with multiple neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular traits (PFDR values < 5.0x10-2). In pathway-level tests, we observed three significant associations with resilience: metabolism of amino acids and derivatives (PFDR=4.1x10-2), negative regulation of transforming growth factor beta production (PFDR=1.9x10-2), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (PFDR=3.9x10-4). Finally, in single-variant analyses, we identified a locus on chromosome 17 approaching genome-wide significance among cognitively unimpaired participants (index single nucleotide polymorphism: rs757022, minor allele frequency = 0.18, β=0.08, P=1.1x10-7). The top variant at this locus (rs757022) was significantly associated with expression of numerous ATP-binding cassette genes in brain. Overall, through validating a novel modeling approach, we demonstrate the utility of silver models of resilience to increase statistical power and participant diversity."

Association of neighborhood disadvantage with cognitive function and cortical disorganization in an unimpaired cohort: An exploratory study.	Neighborhood disadvantage has been shown to impact health and cognitive outcomes, while morphological similarity network (MSN) can elucidate structural morphological patterns underlying cognitive functions. We hypothesized MSNs could provide cortical patterns linked with neighborhood disadvantage and cognitive function, explaining the potential risk of cognitive impairment in disadvantaged neighborhoods. For cognitively unimpaired participants from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center or Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (n = 524), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (n = 100), neighborhood disadvantage was obtained using Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and its association with cognitive performance and MSN features was analyzed using linear regression and mediation analysis. Neighborhood disadvantage was associated with worse cognitive performance on memory, executive function, processing speed, and preclinical Alzheimer's tests on both datasets. Local morphological organization of predominantly the frontal and temporal regions showed association trends with ADI. Morphological patterns associated with ADI, in-part, may explain the risk for poor cognitive functioning in a neighborhood disadvantaged population. Social determinants of health such as neighborhood context can be studied using ADI. High neighborhood disadvantage was related to worse performance on category fluency, implicit learning speed, story recall memory and pre-clinical Alzheimer's cognitive composite. In this exploratory study, using morphological brain networks that indicate similarity in distribution of cortical thickness between regions, we observed that centrality of predominantly frontal and temporal regions was marginally linked with neighborhood disadvantage status and also partially mediated its association with preclinical Alzheimer's composite test. There is a potential role for considering neighborhood status in early screening of cognitive impairment and dementia.

The impact of arteriolosclerosis on cognitive impairment in decedents without severe dementia from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center.	Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), Lewy body disease (LBD), and vascular neuropathologies occur together. Previous studies have been limited by a large majority of participants with severe dementia or advanced stages of pathologies, which limits the detectability of cognitive effects from vascular neuropathologies. Using neuropathology data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, we examined the association of vascular neuropathologies with cognitive scores in participants without severe dementia (N = 1526) using multivariable linear regression. Controlling for age, sex, education, LBD, and ADNC, arteriolosclerosis was associated with lower memory (β = -0.16 ± 0.06, p < 0.001), executive function (β = -0.25 ± 0.05, p < 0.001), and language scores (β = -0.20 ± 0.05, p < 0.001). The effects of arteriolosclerosis remained when controlling for vascular risk factors. Vascular neuropathologies exhibit distinct relationships with cognition. Arteriolosclerosis is an independent contributor to cognition. Further research should be conducted on whether arteriolosclerosis can serve as a surrogate marker for cognitive decline in early disease stages. In individuals who do not have severe dementia, vascular neuropathologies are common, and the combination of pathologies is heterogeneous in a convenience sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center that reported all the neuropathology data elements for this investigation. Arteriolosclerosis is associated with several cognitive domain scores, including memory, executive function, and language when controlling for the effects of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change and Lewy body disease.

Distinct medical and substance use histories associate with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.	Phenotype clustering reduces patient heterogeneity and could be useful when designing precision clinical trials. We hypothesized that the onset of early cognitive decline in patients would exhibit variance predicated on the clinical history documented prior to an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Self-reported medical and substance use history (i.e., problem history) was used to cluster participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) into distinct subtypes. Linear mixed effects modeling was used to determine the effect of problem history subtype on cognitive decline over 2 years. Two thousand seven hundred fifty-four individuals were partitioned into three subtypes: minimal (n = 1380), substance use (n = 1038), and cardiovascular (n = 336). The cardiovascular problem history subtype had significantly worse cognitive decline over a 2 year follow-up period (p = 0.013). Our study highlights the need to account for problem history to reduce heterogeneity of outcomes in AD clinical trials. Clinical data were used to identify subtypes of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset. Three problem history subtypes were found: minimal, substance use, and cardiovascular. The mean change in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) was assessed over a 2 year follow-up. The cardiovascular subtype was associated with the worst cognitive decline. The magnitude of change in CDR-SB was similar to recent AD clinical trials.

Blood biomarkers differentiate AD-related versus non-AD-related cognitive deficits.	The utility of blood-based biomarkers for discriminating Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related versus non-AD-related cognitive deficits in preclinical populations remains poorly understood. Here, we tested the capability of blood markers to detect and discriminate variation in performance across multiple cognitive domains in a cognitively unimpaired sample. Participants (n = 648, aged 69.9 ± 3.8, 71% female) underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment and assays for plasma-based biomarkers amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42/1-40 by mass spectrometry, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181 and 217, p-tau217/Aβ1-42, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL). Greater p-tau217 was exclusively associated with poorer episodic memory performance (β = -0.11, SE = 0.04, p = .003), and remained so after covarying for NfL. Higher NfL was non-specifically associated with poorer performance across a range of cognitive domains and remained so after covarying for p-tau217. Blood-based biomarkers may differentiate non-AD-related versus AD-related cognitive deficits. This characterization will be important for early intervention and disease monitoring for AD. There is heterogeneity in the causes of cognitive decline in aging. AD-related blood biomarkers may help characterize these causes. Elevated p-tau217 was exclusively associated with poorer episodic memory. Elevated NfL was associated with poorer cognition in a broad range of domains. Blood biomarkers may help differentiate AD- and non-AD-related cognitive deficits.	Alzheimer's disease; biomarkers; blood‐based biomarkers; cognition; cognitive function

Mediterranean vs. Western diet effects on the primate cerebral cortical pre-synaptic proteome: Relationships with the transcriptome and multi-system phenotypes.	Diet quality mediates aging-related risks of cognitive decline, neurodegeneration, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) through poorly defined mechanisms. The effects of diet on the presynaptic proteome of the temporal cortex were assessed in 36 female cynomolgus macaques randomized to Mediterranean or Western diets for 31 months. Associations between the presynaptic proteome, determined by synaptometry by time-of-flight (SynTOF) mass spectrometry, adjacent cortex transcriptome, and multi-system phenotypes were assessed using a machine learning approach. Six presynaptic proteins (DAT, Aβ42, calreticulin, LC3B, K48-Ubiquitin, SLC6A8) were elevated in the presynaptic proteome in Mediterranean diet consumers (p < 0.05). Transcriptomic data and multi-system phenotypes significantly predicted SynTOF markers. Selected SynTOF markers were correlated with changes in white matter volumes, hepatosteatosis, and behavioral and physiological measures of psychosocial stress. These observations demonstrate that diet composition drives cortical presynaptic protein composition, that transcriptional profiles strongly predict the presynaptic proteomic profile, and that presynaptic proteins were closely associated with peripheral metabolism, stress responsivity, neuroanatomy, and socio-emotional behavior. Mediterranean and Western diets differentially altered the cortical presynaptic proteome, which is strongly associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Presynaptic proteomic markers were predicted by transcriptomic profiles in the adjacent cortex, and by multi-system anatomical, physiologic, and behavioral phenotypes. The data demonstrate that brain phenotypes and brain-body interactions are influenced by common dietary patterns, suggesting that improving diet quality may be an effective means to maintain brain health.

Ethnic and Sex Differences in the Association Between Organochlorine Exposure and Cognitive Function in Late Life.	Organochlorine pesticides persist in the environment and body for extended periods. However, little is known about their long-term impact on cognition in older adults and if their influence differs by race/ethnicity (hereinafter ethnicity) and sex. We evaluated cognitive function and organochlorine levels by ethnicity and sex in 979 adults, age 60+ from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2011-2014). We utilized weighted linear generalized estimating equations to measure differences between seven log-transformed lipid-adjusted organochlorines (ng/g) and cognitive function. A composite cognitive function score was created using the mean of the z-scores from immediate and delayed of a word-list memory test, verbal fluency, and digit substitution test. Covariates included age, education, marital status, sex, and ethnicity. Exploratory sensitivity analyses included BMI, Ratio of Income-to-Poverty (IPR), and occupation, which were added to the models individually. Weighted sample included: 55.4% females; 79.8% NH-White; 9.2% NH-Black; 3.4% Mexican-American; 4.0% Other-Hispanic; 3.5% NH-Asian. We found significant differences in cognitive outcomes and organochlorine levels across ethnic and sex groups. The variability in cognitive performance and organochlorine exposure both within and between these groups, suggests that organochlorines may play a role in cognitive disparities, despite limited significant interaction effects. Sensitivity analyses adjusting for BMI, IPR, and longest occupation held indicated that most specific-organochlorine associations remained significant. Our findings emphasize the importance of examining both the distributions of organochlorines and cognition by ethnicity and sex and their interactions to understand how each may contribute to cognitive health disparities in older adults.

Comorbid cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors (CVM) differentially impact brain structure and increase dementia risk, but their specific magnetic resonance imaging signatures (MRI) remain poorly characterized. To address this, we developed and validated machine learning models to quantify the distinct spatial patterns of atrophy and white matter hyperintensities related to hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, and type-2 diabetes mellitus at the patient level. Using harmonized MRI data from 37,096 participants (45-85 years) in a large multinational dataset of 10 cohort studies, we generated five in silico severity markers that: i) outperformed conventional structural MRI markers with a ten-fold increase in effect sizes, ii) captured subtle patterns at sub-clinical CVM stages, iii) were most sensitive in mid-life (45-64 years), iv) were associated with brain beta-amyloid status, and v) showed stronger associations with cognitive performance than diagnostic CVM status. Integrating personalized measurements of CVM-specific brain signatures into phenotypic frameworks could guide early risk detection and stratification in clinical studies.

Absence of care among community-dwelling older adults with dementia and functional limitations.	Assistance with daily activities is crucial for persons living with dementia and functional limitations, yet many face substantial challenges in accessing adequate care and support. Using harmonized longitudinal survey data (2012-2018) from the United States, England, 18 European countries, Israel and China, we found that at least one-fifth of persons with dementia and functional limitations received no personal assistance for basic activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living, regardless of regional development level. Care gaps were widespread across both basic activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living limitations, as well as for informal and formal care. Disparities were evident, with less educated people more likely to lack formal care, whereas those living alone often lacked informal support, resulting in the absence of any care. Alarmingly, care availability showed no improvement over time. Our findings underscore the urgent need for policies to address inequities and ensure critical access to care services for this vulnerable population worldwide.

Biofluid-based staging of Alzheimer's disease.	Recently, conceptual systems for the in vivo staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using fluid biomarkers have been suggested. Thus, it is important to assess whether available fluid biomarkers can successfully stage AD into clinically and biologically relevant categories. In the TRIAD cohort, we explored whether p-tau217, p-tau205 and NTA-tau (biomarkers of early, intermediate and late AD pathology, respectively) have potential for biofluid-based staging in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 219) and plasma (n = 150), and compared them in a paired CSF and plasma subset (n = 76). Our findings suggest a good concordance between biofluid staging and underlying pathology when classifying amyloid-positivity into three categories based on neurofibrillary pathology: minimal/non-existent (p-tau217 positive), early-to-intermediate (p-tau217 and p-tau205 positivity), and advanced tau tangle deposition (p-tau217, p-tau205 and NTA-tau positive), as indexed by tau-PET. Discordant cases accounted for 4.6% and 13.3% of all CSF and plasma measurements respectively (9.2% and 11.8% in paired samples). Notably, CSF- and plasma-based staging matched one another in 61.7% of the cases, while approximately 32% of the remaining participants were one to three biofluid stages higher in CSF as compared to plasma. Overall, these exploratory results suggest that biofluid staging of AD holds potential for offering valuable insights into underlying AD hallmarks and disease severity. However, its applicability beyond molecular characterization at research settings has yet to be demonstrated.	Alzheimer; CSF; Plasma; Staging; Tau; p-Tau

The impact of cardiorespiratory fitness on Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and their relationships with cognitive decline.	Relationships between core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker accumulation and cognitive decline are well-established and the literature generally suggests a favorable relationship of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on AD biomarker accumulation and cognition. Differences in risk of biomarker status conversion or accumulation rates by CRF, or their potential interactive relationships with cognitive decline remain largely unknown. Participants (N=533; Mean No significant relationships were observed between eCRF and biomarker trajectories. However, those in the high eCRF group who were also Aβ- (HR[95%CI]=0.42[0.20, 0.88]) and pTau-217-(HR[95%CI]=0.45[0.21, 0.97]) at baseline had a significantly lower risk of becoming biomarker-positive. There was a significant attenuation of the detrimental relationship between Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline for those with high eCRF and Aβ+/T+. While CRF did not influence core AD biomarker accumulation trajectories, high CRF did seem to protect against becoming biomarker-positive and attenuate the known deleterious relationship between biomarker accumulation and cognitive decline in Aβ+/T+.

Diverse somatic genomic alterations in single neurons in chronic traumatic encephalopathy.	Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease that is linked to exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI), yet little is known about its pathogenesis. Applying two single-cell whole-genome sequencing methods to hundreds of neurons from prefrontal cortex of 15 individuals with CTE, and 4 with RHI without CTE, revealed increased somatic single-nucleotide variants in CTE, resembling a pattern previously reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, we discovered remarkably high burdens of somatic small insertions and deletions in a subset of CTE individuals, resembling a known pattern, ID4, also found in AD. Our results suggest that neurons in CTE experience stereotyped mutational processes shared with AD; the absence of similar changes in RHI neurons without CTE suggests that CTE involves mechanisms beyond RHI alone.

Amyloid PET in Sporadic Early- Versus Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: Comparison of the LEADS and ADNI Cohorts.	Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) differ in many respects. Here, we address the issue of possible differences in fibrillar amyloid pathology as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), which remains unresolved due to the lack of large-scale comparative studies. Three hundred ninety-nine cognitively impaired participants younger than 65 years of age from the multicenter Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) and 450 cognitively impaired participants older than 65 years from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent clinical assessment, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and amyloid PET and were included in this study. We compared amyloid PET outcomes (positivity rate based on visual read and quantified tracer uptake expressed as Centiloids [CLs]) between the 2 cohorts and studied their association with age, sex, APOE genotype, and cognition. The amyloid positivity rate was higher in LEADS (78%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74-82) than in ADNI (71%, 95% CI = 67-75, p = 0.02). Lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and APOE4 genotype increased the odds of amyloid positivity in both cohorts. Visually positive scans had higher CLs in LEADS (EOAD, mean = 95.3 ± 26.1) than in ADNI (LOAD, mean = 80.9 ± 36.8, p < 0.0001), predominantly in parietal cortex/precuneus, superior temporal, and frontal cortices. In amyloid-positive patients, (1) CLs were higher in female patients in both cohorts; (2) APOE4 carriership was associated with lower CLs in EOAD, which was not observed in LOAD; and (3) correlations between CLs and MMSE scores were significantly stronger in EOAD than in LOAD. Differences in the burden of amyloid pathology may contribute to differences in clinical and anatomic patterns in sporadic EOAD and LOAD, and have implications for optimizing therapeutic strategies in each group.

Changes in β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (T) in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) precede Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms, making the CSF proteome a potential avenue to understand disease pathophysiology and facilitate reliable diagnostics and therapies. Using the AT framework and a three-stage study design (discovery, replication, and meta-analysis), we identified 2,173 analytes (2,029 unique proteins) dysregulated in AD. Of these, 865 (43%) were previously reported, and 1,164 (57%) are novel. The identified proteins cluster in four different pseudo-trajectories groups spanning the AD continuum and were enriched in pathways including neuronal death, apoptosis, and tau phosphorylation (early stages), microglia dysregulation and endolysosomal dysfunction (mid stages), brain plasticity and longevity (mid stages), and microglia-neuron crosstalk (late stages). Using machine learning, we created and validated highly accurate and replicable (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.90) models that predict AD biomarker positivity and clinical status. These models can also identify people that will convert to AD.	ATN; Alzheimer disease; CSF; SomaScan; biomarkers; dementia progression; machine learning; proteomics; pseudo-trajectory

Distributed collaborative control to pose tracking for six-DOF parallel mechanism under multi-cylinder communication.	Determining how to enhance performance of pose tracking in internal uncertainties, external disturbances, and the mutual interference among actuators is a promising research topic for six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel mechanism. To address these challenges, this study introduces a collaborative pose tracking control strategy that integrates third-order active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) for a single actuator and multi-agent consensus control for multiple actuators. Solved the problem of reduced pose tracking accuracy caused by internal modeling uncertainty of actuators, external interference, and mutual interference between actuators. And the stability of this control approach is theoretically proven. Subsequently, the control strategy is implemented on a six-DOF parallel mechanism for comprehensive simulation and experimental. Simulation and experimental results show that compared with using an ADRC to regulate a single actuator, the proposed control strategy reduces position and attitude errors by about 90%, verifying the effectiveness of the control strategy proposed in this paper.

Correlation between changes in apathy and cognition in Alzheimer's disease associated apathy: Analysis of the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2).	Previous trials have shown improvements in both apathy and cognition with methylphenidate (MPH). To assess whether changes in apathy correlated with changes in cognition in the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2). Mild to moderate AD patients with clinically significant apathy randomized to MPH (20 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months. Apathy was measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-apathy (NPI-A) domain. Cognition was measured using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Hopkins Verbal Learning (immediate [HVLT-I], delayed [HVLT-D] recall), Digit Span (Forward [DF], Backward [DB]), Trail Making (TMT-A, TMT-B), Action Verbal Fluency (AV), Category Fluency (CF), and the Short Boston Naming Test (BNT). Linear mixed models included cognitive change scores as dependent variables and time, treatment, change in NPI-A and the interaction between treatment and change in NPI-A as independent variables, which were additionally adjusted for baseline NPI-A and cognitive scores, age, sex, level of education and presence of diabetes. 199 participants (66 % male) were included (98-MPH, 101-placebo). Among all participants, worsening CF was associated with worsening apathy (-0.15 (0.05), p = .003). In addition, change in HVLT-I was associated with the interaction between changes in apathy and treatment (-0.31 (0.07), p = 0.0000158). Changes in apathy are mostly independent of cognitive changes and apathy response to MPH may be independent from cognition. These results are consistent with the view that apathy as a syndrome is related to but distinct from cognition.	Alzheimer’s disease; Apathy; Cognition; Methylphenidate

Failure to recover from proactive semantic interference predicts trajectory of decline in everyday function among older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment.	To evaluate the predictive utility of proactive semantic interference (PSI) and failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) deficits on the longitudinal everyday functional decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) among older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Longitudinal prospective cohort study. 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (1FLADRC). 97 older adults aged 54 to 98 years who were diagnosed with aMCI following a baseline evaluation. The average age was 71.9 years, 51 % male, average education 15.7 years, and 56 % Hispanic. The mean MMSE score was 28.0. Participants were followed annually for 3 to 4 visits with a mean follow-up time of 38.9 months (range 22.7 to 70.3 months). CDR-SOB were obtained at each visit and the latent growth curve trajectory of CDR-SOB was estimated. The associations between PSI and frPSI and the growth curve trajectory of CDR-SOB were examined. The growth curve model that best fits the CDR-SOB trajectory was a linear form and included the fixed and random effect of intercept and slope of time. After adjusting for age, sex, education, Hispanic background, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) immediate and delayed recall, and amyloid positivity, frPSI (β = -0.134, se=0.04, p < 0.01) remained statistically significant in predicting a steeper slope on the trajectory of decline in CDR-SOB. frPSI at baseline predicted the rate of everyday functional decline over time among participants with aMCI regardless of amyloid status and demonstrated its utility of longitudinal prediction of change in CDR-SOB.

Obfuscation via pitch-shifting for balancing privacy and diagnostic utility in voice-based cognitive assessment.	Digital voice analysis is an emerging tool for differentiating cognitive states, but it poses privacy risks as automated systems may inadvertently identify speakers. We developed a computational framework to evaluate the trade-off between voice obfuscation and cognitive assessment accuracy, using pitch-shifting as a representative method. This framework was applied to voice recordings from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS, n = 128) and the DementiaBank Delaware (DBD, n = 85) corpus, both featuring responses to neuropsychological tests. Speaker obfuscation was measured via equal error rate (EER), and diagnostic utility was assessed through machine learning models distinguishing cognitive states: normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia (DE). With the top 20 acoustic features, our framework achieved classification accuracies of 62.2% (EER: 0.3335) on the FHS dataset for NC, MCI, and DE differentiation, and 63.7% (EER: 0.1796) on the DBD dataset for NC and MCI differentiation, using obfuscated speech files. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of privacy-preserving voice markers, offering a scalable solution for voice-based cognitive assessments. We developed a computational framework using pitch-shifting and acoustic transformations to balance speaker privacy and diagnostic utility in voice-based cognitive assessments. We evaluated the framework on two independent datasets, Framingham Heart Study (FHS, n = 128) and DementiaBank Delaware (DBD, n = 85) corpus, assessing the trade-off between privacy (measured by equal error rate [EER]) and classification accuracy. Our framework achieved classification accuracies of 62.2% (EER: 0.3335) for distinguishing normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia in the FHS dataset and 63.7% (EER: 0.1796) for NC and MCI differentiation in the DBD dataset, using obfuscated speech files. Our framework demonstrates that pitch-shifting levels can preserve diagnostic utility while protecting speaker identity, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution.	cognitive assessment; digital health; privacy; voice recordings

Associations between cerebrospinal fluid synaptic protein biomarkers and cognitive function in bipolar disorder.	This study is the first to investigate the association between a comprehensive panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) synaptic protein biomarkers and cognitive function using data from a prospective cohort study including N = 59 patients with bipolar disorder (BD) in remission and N = 37 healthy control individuals (HC). The CSF synaptic protein biomarkers included neuronal pentraxin (NPTX)1, NPTX2, 14-3-3 proteins, AP-2 complex subunit-beta, beta-synuclein, complexin-2, gamma-synuclein, NPTX-receptor, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins, rab GDP dissociation inhibitor-alpha, syntaxins-1B and 7. The biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction were analyzed by targeted mass spectrometry. The primary cognition measure was a global cognitive composite score based on neuropsychological tests of verbal learning and memory, executive function, psychomotor speed, and sustained attention. Our primary hypothesis was that levels of NPTX1 and NPTX2 were associated with global cognition and verbal memory. The study revealed consistent positive associations between CSF concentrations of NPTX1 and NPTX2 and global cognitive function. However, only the association with a tryptic peptide from NPTX2 (VAELEDEK) remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple tests. No consistent trends or significant relationships were found between NPTX1 and NPTX2 and verbal memory. NPTXs showed positive associations with sustained attention, and the NPTX receptor was positively associated with global cognition scores. Similar trends were found in BD patients and HC individuals. The study provides novel evidence for a potentially pivotal role of CSF synaptic proteins, particularly NPTX1, NPTX2, and NPTX-receptor, in shaping global cognitive function across BD and HC populations and increases our understanding of the neurobiological foundations for cognitive functions across diagnostic boundaries.

The role of cerebrovascular reactivity on brain activation during a working memory task in type 2 diabetes.	Impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is common in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients and is a risk factor for dementia. However, most prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in T2D disregarded the impact of impaired CVR on brain activation patterns. This study investigated the relationship between CVR and brain activation during an fMRI task in T2D patients. Seventy-four T2D patients underwent a working-memory (WM) fMRI task. CVR was measured by the breath-holding index test using transcranial Doppler (TCD). Regression analyses examined associations between CVR and brain activation and between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and activation with/without adjusting for CVR. An association between CVR and brain activation was found in the left middle and inferior frontal gyri. Adjusting for CVR led to a different pattern of HbA1c-related activation. The findings highlight methodological implications, emphasizing the importance of accounting for impaired CVR when analyzing and interpreting fMRI data in T2D patients. The study found that cerebrovascular reactivity impacts brain activation patterns during a working memory task in type 2 diabetes patients.Accounting for cerebrovascular reactivity altered the brain regions showing activation related to working memory and glycemic control.The findings highlight the importance of considering vascular factors when interpreting fMRI data in populations with vascular dysfunction.

Therapeutic development for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is hindered by the lack of biomarkers that inform susceptibility/risk, prognosis, and the underlying causative pathology. Blood glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) has garnered attention as a FTD biomarker. However, investigations of GFAP in FTD have been hampered by symptomatic and histopathologic heterogeneity and small cohort sizes contributing to inconsistent findings. Therefore, we evaluated plasma GFAP as a FTD biomarker and compared its performance to that of neurofilament light (NfL) protein, a leading FTD biomarker. We availed ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) study resources to conduct a comprehensive cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of the susceptibility/risk, prognostic, and predictive performance of GFAP and NfL in the largest series of well-characterized presymptomatic FTD mutation carriers and participants with sporadic or familial FTD syndromes. Utilizing single molecule array technology, we measured GFAP and NfL in plasma from 161 controls, 127 presymptomatic mutation carriers, 702 participants with a FTD syndrome, and 67 participants with mild behavioral and/or cognitive changes. We used multivariable linear regression and Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for co-variates to examine the biomarker utility of baseline GFAP and NfL concentrations or their rates of change. Compared to controls, GFAP and NfL were elevated in each FTD syndrome but GFAP, unlike NfL, poorly discriminated controls from participants with mild symptoms. Similarly, both baseline GFAP and NfL were higher in presymptomatic mutation carriers who later phenoconverted, but NfL better distinguished non-converters from phenoconverters. We additionally observed that GFAP and NfL were associated with disease severity indicators and survival, but NfL far outperformed GFAP. Nevertheless, we validated findings that the GFAP/NfL ratio may discriminate frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau versus TDP-43 pathology. Our head-to-head comparison of plasma GFAP and NfL as biomarkers for FTD indicate that NfL consistently outmatched GFAP as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for participants with a FTD syndrome, and as a susceptibility/risk biomarker for people at genetic risk of FTD. Our findings underscore the need to include leading biomarkers in investigations evaluating new biomarkers if the field is to fully ascertain their performance and clinical value.

Therapeutic Potential of Adipose-Derived Regenerative Cells for Ischemic Diseases.	Adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) are one of the most promising cell sources that possess significant therapeutic effects. They have now become a main source of cell therapy for the treatment of ischemic diseases due to their easy accessibility, expansion, and differentiation. Additionally, ADRCs can release multiple paracrine factors and extracellular vesicles that contribute to tissue regeneration by promoting angiogenesis, regulating inflammation, alleviating apoptosis, and inhibiting fibrosis. However, ADRCs still have some limitations to realize their full therapeutic potential. To address these issues, protective mechanistic studies and bioengineering studies have been carried out. This review focused on the recently studied mechanisms, such as paracrine factors, cell fusion, and mitochondrial transfer, involving the therapeutic potential of ADRCs in ischemic diseases and discussed some modification techniques of ADRCs.

Development of a Situation-Specific Biopsychosocial Model of Pain in Heart Failure.	Theories of pain have been developed in several patient populations, but none currently exist for heart failure (HF) that include contributing factors and associated outcomes. We developed a situation-specific theory of pain in HF by adapting the biopsychosocial model of pain. Existing theoretical and empirical literature in HF samples was utilized to construct the new theory. Components, contributing factors, and associated outcomes of pain in HF are presented in the new theory. Areas in need of additional research are emphasized, and strengths and limitations are discussed. This theory could provide a foundation for future pain research initiatives in HF. Key words: pain, heart failure, theoretical model.
